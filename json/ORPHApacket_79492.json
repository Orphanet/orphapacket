It can occur in each type of hair; mostly in bread of men or in the other uncommon locations of the body (such as the back or abdomen). Folliculitis may also be present. Most of the patients are asymptomatic however some may present with recurrent inflammatory lesions which can have residual atrophic or hypertrophic scars. Persisting itching is also reported in some patients."
