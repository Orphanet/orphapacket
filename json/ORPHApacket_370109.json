Patients typically present extrapyramidal signs such as resting tremor choreathetosis and dystonia as the initial symptoms and later often develop mild cerebellar ataxia (with gait usually preserved). Telangiectasia and immunodeficiency may be absent but secondary features of ataxia-telangiectasia such as risk of malignancy dysarthria and peripheral neuropathy are frequently present."
