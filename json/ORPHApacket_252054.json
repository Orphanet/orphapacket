            "Contents": "A rare benign highly vascularized tumor characterized by various symptoms depending on the location. They typically occur in the brain (typically cerebellum in addition to brainstem cerebrum) and spinal cord and predominantly affect the central nervous system. However they can also be found in peripheral nerves bone and soft tissue liver lung pancreas kidney intestines and skin in a lesser extent. They most commonly occur sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Patients having cerebellar tumors often present with headaches nausea vomiting and signs of increased intracranial pressure whereas patients having brainstem tumors develop motor and sensory deficits ataxia and potentially fatal hemorrhages. Hemangioblastomas located in spinal cord may result in localized pain motor weakness sensory disturbances and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Patients having optic nerve hemangioblastoma were also reported of either being asymptomatic or manifest vision loss proptosis and pain."
