            "Contents": "A rare renal disease characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy developing <i>de novo</i> in kidney transplant recipients with no evidence of occurrence of the disease prior to transplantation. Precipitating factors include antibody-mediated rejection immunosuppressive medication viral infections and genetic abnormalities in the complement cascade among others. The condition most commonly occurs within the first 3-6 months post-transplantation. Clinical presentation is highly variable and ranges from a limited form confined to the kidney with relatively good prognosis to a systemic variant consisting of the classic triad of thrombocytopenia microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute kidney injury."
