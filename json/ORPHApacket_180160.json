The condition is only rarely diagnosed in neonates or infants unless it causes significant hydromucocolpos. Complete septa present with primary amenorrhea cyclic pelvic pain dyspareunia or a pelvic mass consisting of accumulated menstrual blood while incomplete septa may lead to dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea."
