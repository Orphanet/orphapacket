            "Contents": "A rare primary bone dysplasia with multiple joint dislocations characterized by stunted stature articular hypermobility and spinal malalignment resulting in severe progressive kyphosis. Joint dislocations include bilateral dislocation of the radial heads with elbow contractures feet (bilateral talipes equinovarus) and congenital dislocations of the hip and genu valgus. Joint laxity is particularly observed in fingers. Spinal changes include moderate platyspondyly with anterior projection of the vertebral bodies. Facial features of oval face with a flattened nasal bridge button nose long upper lip prominent eyes and blue sclera are characteristic but variable. Patients may also present mild skin extensibility spatulate terminal phalanges lip and palate clefts micrognathia and structural cardiac malformations."
