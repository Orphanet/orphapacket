            "Contents": "A rare reflex epilepsy characterized by reading-induced seizures which in most cases present with orofacial/jaw myoclonus possibly extending to the upper limbs but can also manifest as dyslexia or alexia and visual symptoms. In both variants secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures may evolve if the stimulus is not interrupted. The disease typically begins in the second or third decade of life and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It usually takes a benign course with little tendency to spontaneous seizures."
