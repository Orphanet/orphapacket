Intralobar pulmonary sequestration may be asymptomatic or may present with recurrent pulmonary infections hemoptysis chest pain cough and is usually diagnosed in older children and adults. Extralobar pulmonary sequestration present with respiratory distress cyanosis difficulty feeding or infection may be associated with other anomalies and is mostly diagnosed in neonates or infants."
