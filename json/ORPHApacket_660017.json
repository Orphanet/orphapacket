            "Contents": "A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by early-onset global developmental delay intellectual disability speech and language impairment early-onset hypotonia and movement abnormalities (including dystonia and parkinsonism) that are usually L-dopa responsive. Various types of seizures (including tonic-clonic focal generalized and absence seizures infantile spasms and rolandic epilepsy) and behavioral problems (including autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder tantrums anxiety and hyposensitivity to temperature and pain) are also reported in the majority of the patients. The severity of the symptoms varies ranging from mild to severe. Mildly affected individuals exhibit normal early development until the first symptoms appear in infancy including delayed speech and mild intellectual disability. Additional clinical features may include abnormal eye movements trichotillomania feeding and sleeping difficulties. Patients may harbor 2q24 microdeletion including the <i>NR4A2</i> gene or have <i>de novo</i> mutations in this gene."
