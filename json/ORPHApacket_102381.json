The neoplastic cells often show rearrangements involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene at 11q23. This subgroup of t-MN is typically associated with overt leukemia without preceding myelodysplastic syndrome developing 2-3 years after exposure presenting with non-specific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement."
