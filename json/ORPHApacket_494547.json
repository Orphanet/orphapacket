The tumor can spread directly to adjacent structures or metastasize via lymphatic and blood vessels to regional lymph nodes or lung liver and bones respectively. Primary risk factors are tobacco smoking and (to a lesser extent) alcohol consumption. Patients may present with odynophagia dysphagia signs and symptoms related to a neck mass voice changes otalgia and constitutional symptoms."
