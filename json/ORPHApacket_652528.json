The additional kidney(s) smaller than native ones mostly occurs ipsilateral and caudal to the left kidney and may be fused to the native kidneys. Patients are usually asymptomatic but they may present with symptoms such as pain a palpable abdominal mass fever and sometimes with urinary symptoms (such as urinary incontinence) when supernumerary kidneys occur with an ectopic ureter. Additional congenital abnormalities icluding horseshoe kidney malformation ventricular septal defect and cloacal abnormalities (such as urethral atresia vaginal atresia ectopic ureter implantation imperforate anus and duplication of urethra) may also be present in some patients."
