            "Contents": "A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a benign subcutaneous lesion composed of oval-to-spindle shaped myoid appearing cells with a tendency for concentric perivascular growth. The tumor usually presents as a painless slowly growing nodule which may be solitary or appear as multiple lesions which then arise metachronously and usually involve a particular anatomic region. Recurrence after surgical excision may occur in poorly circumscribed tumors. Malignancy is very rare."
