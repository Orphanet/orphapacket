Most patients reported to also have an autism spectrum disorder. Overlapping facial features were reported in some patients including broad forehead with high anterior hairline finely arched eyebrows short philtrum thin or tented upper lip. Other clinical features may involve mild distal skeletal abnormalities hypotonia hearing loss feeding problems and skin abnormalities."
