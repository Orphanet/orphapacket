General symptoms are pain tenderness swelling and/or weakness in the affected muscle. Most common causative agent are <i>Candida</i> species with myositis developing in the setting of systemic candidiasis typically as diffuse multiple microabscesses. Other fungal pathogens potentially causing myositis are <i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i> <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i> <i>Coccidioides</i> species or <i>Aspergillus</i> species among others."
