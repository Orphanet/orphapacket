            "Contents": "A rare viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by virus-induced microvascular leakage rapidly leading to a severe illness with diffuse pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. These symptoms set in after a short first disease stage with fever myalgia and headache followed by severe gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea. The high lethality of the disease is due to the possible development of hypotension and cardiogenic shock."
