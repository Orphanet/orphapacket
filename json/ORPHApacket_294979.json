            "Contents": "Congenital absence of both forearm and hand is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by unilateral or bilateral arrest of proximal to distal development of the upper limb leading to a transverse deficiency with absence of the forearm wrist and hand. A short below-the-elbow amputation is most commonly observed and the residual limb is usually well cushioned with rudimentary nubbins or dumpling possibly found on the end."
