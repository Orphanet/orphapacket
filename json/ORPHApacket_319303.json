It is frequently asymptomatic or may present with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss fever or fatigue. The classic presentation observed in renal tumors (hematuria flank pain and palpable mass) is occasionally observed and usually indicates an advanced stage of the disease. It is most frequently sporadic however several familial cases associated with Birt-Hogg Dub√© syndrome have been described."
