Most of the patients have vision abnormalities respiratory system abnormalities (including chronic respiratory insufficiency and tracheostomy that may lead to ventilator dependency) and feeding difficulties (percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy). Skin abnormalities including hyperhidrosis can be present."
