Clinical features include irregular or absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) irregular ovulation and altered hormone profile (hypoestrogenism and elevated serum gonadotropin levels) associated to fragile X premutation. Most of the patients have fertility problems (subfertility or infertility) and undergo early menopause."
