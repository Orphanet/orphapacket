Invasive infection most commonly occurs in immunocompromised individuals and patients with breaches in normal defensive barriers (such as intravascular lines or urinary catheters). Patients may develop urinary tract infection bacteremia and endocarditis as well as infections of the abdomen pelvis biliary tract and wounds. Less frequent infection sites include the bone joints and meninges among others."
