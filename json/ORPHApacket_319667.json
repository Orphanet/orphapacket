            "Contents": "Primary lymphoma of the conjunctiva is an extremely rare clonal lymphoid proliferation of the ocular surface with an indolent course. Clinically it presents with treatment-resistant conjunctivitis ptosis excessive tear production or as a painless salmon-pink ''fleshy'' patch with a smooth or multinodular surface on the bulbar conjunctiva. Histologically it is usually B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (most often extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma followed by follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) with conjunctival T-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma being very rare."
