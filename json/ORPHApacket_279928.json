            "Contents": "A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by a non-infectious uveitis potentially involving all parts of the uveal tract and due to a paraneoplastic autoimmune reaction. The signs and symptoms usually precede the tumor diagnosis and may include ocular redness and pain light sensitivity blurred vision floaters and decreased vision. The most classic form is the intermediate uveitis associated with anti-CV2 antibodies in small-cell lung cancer or other neoplasms. Other ocular and/or extra-ocular manifestations are commonly present in addition."
