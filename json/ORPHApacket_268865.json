Histopathology reveals columnar or cuboidal epithelium with or without cilia and mucus globules. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with signs and symptoms of compression of the spinal cord and associated nerve roots such as focal weakness progressive paresis paresthesias gait disturbance or radicular pain. Concomitant congenital vertebral anomalies are frequently observed."
