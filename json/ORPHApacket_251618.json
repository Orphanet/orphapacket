            "Contents": "A rare astrocytoma characterized by a benign slowly growing lesion that typically arises in the walls of the lateral ventricles and most commonly occurs in patients <&nbsp;20 years with tuberous sclerosis complex. Most patients present with worsening epilepsy or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. This WHO grade 1 tumor is composed of astrocytes with various phenotypes (i.e. polygonal gemistocytic spindle and ganglionic-like). On immunohistochemistry it is usually positive for GFAP S100 beta-tubulin neurofilament synaptophysin NeuN TTF1 and phosphorylated S6 but shows weak or negative staining for tuberin hamartin and Ki-67. It has its specific DNA methylation profile."
