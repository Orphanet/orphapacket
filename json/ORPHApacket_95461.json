            "Contents": "Straddling or overriding tricuspid valve is a rare congenital tricuspid valve malformation characterized by the tricuspid valve that overrides the ventricular septum and communicates with both ventricles as part of the tension apparatus of the valve crosses the ventricular septal defect and is attached in the left ventricle. The anomaly occurs with other congenital heart defects (transposition of great vessels left ventricle outflow tract obstruction double outlet right ventricle hypoplastic right ventricle) which determine the main clinical manifestation."
