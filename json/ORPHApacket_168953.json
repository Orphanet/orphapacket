It usually presents as myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia T lymphoblastic lymphoma with eosinophilia or less frequently acute myeloid leukemia. The presenting signs and symptoms include eosinophilia leukocytosis with leukemoid reaction monocytosis fatigue sweating weight loss lymphadenopathy splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly. Extranodal involvement may include the tonsils lungs and breasts."
