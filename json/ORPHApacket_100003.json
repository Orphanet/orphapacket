            "Contents": "Intraneural perineurioma is a rare tumor of cranial and spinal nerves arising from peripheral nerve sheath and composed exclusively or predominantly of cells showing perineurial differentiation. It presents as a localized tubular or fusiform enlargement of a nerve or nerve segment usually in the extremities or the trunk associated with a motor-predominant mononeuropathy including slow painless gradual loss of motor function in the involved nerve trunk with muscle weakness and atrophy and rarely sensory dysfunction. Cranial nerve involvement is rare."
