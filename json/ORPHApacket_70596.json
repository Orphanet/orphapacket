Indeed the occurrence of congenital infection with EBV has never been demonstrated conclusively and must be very rare. One case has been reported to present after birth multiple congenital anomalies (micrognathia cryptorchidism central cataracts) dystrophy generalized hypotonia hepatosplenomegaly diffuse petechiae and hematomas and multiple areas of metaphysitis of the long bones at birth. A low birth weight was also reported. No specific follow-up of the fetus is recommended following maternal EBV primary-infection."
