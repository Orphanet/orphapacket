Clinical course is usually self-limiting but disseminated illness with high fever hepatosplenomegaly granulomatous osteolytic lesions encephalitis retinitis and atypical pneumonia can also occur. Cat-scratch disease can atypically present as parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (unilateral conjunctivitis and preauricular lymphadenopathy)."
