Patients present with chronically recurrent crops of itchy follicular papulopustules with peripheral extension and central clearing. Small papules tend to enlarge and coalesce into large plaques. The lesions favor the face and trunk although the extremities can also be involved. Laboratory analysis may show peripheral leukocytosis and eosinophilia while clinically systemic involvement is not evident."
