Lymphadenopathy anemia mild to moderate pruritus and increased incidence of other infections (e.g. crusted scabies) have also been reported in some patients. Patients may subsequently develop other HTLV-1 associated conditions such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis (see these terms)."
