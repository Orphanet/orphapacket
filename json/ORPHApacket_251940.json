They are usually supratentorially located large cystic masses with a peripheral solid component characterized by prominent desmoplastic stroma and pleomorphic populations of neoplastic cells with either astrocytic or ganglionic differentiation and poorly differentiated cells in variable proportions. They usually present in the first 18 months of age with rapid head growth bulging anterior fontanel and bone structures over the tumor signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache vomiting papilledema) focal neurological signs and sometimes seizures."
