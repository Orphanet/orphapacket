The neoplastic cells typically harbor unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 7 (monosomy 5/del(5q) and monosomy 7/del(7q)) or a complex karyotype. It usually presents with multilineage dysplasia and cytopenias 5-10 years after exposure with symptoms related to the degree of bone marrow failure and the corresponding cytopenia (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections bone pain)."
