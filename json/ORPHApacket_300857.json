            "Contents": "T-cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) mainly affecting middle-aged men and often not being discovered until an advanced disease stage with involvement of the spleen liver and bone marrow occurring at a greater frequency than in DLBCL. It is often difficult to diagnose due to its similarity with other lymphoid diseases such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma and has an aggressive clinical course."
