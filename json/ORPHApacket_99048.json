            "Contents": "A rare life-threatening congenital non-syndromic conotruncal heart malformation disease characterized by absent or severely undeveloped pulmonary valve leaflets (with a restrictive ring of thickened tissue at the place of the pulmonary valve annulus) associated with an intact ventricular septum and a patent ductus arteriosus manifesting with marked respiratory insufficiency. Additional features include dilated main pulmonary artery (with or without dilatation of pulmonary artery branches) to-and-fro flow at site of the dysplastic pulmonary valve and systolic pressure gradient across narrowed pulmonary valve. Tricuspid atresia and variable extra-cardiac anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia or cleft lip/palate) may be present."
