            "Contents": "Congenital laryngeal palsy is a rare larynx anomaly characterized by unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the vocal cords as a result of dysfunction of the motor nerve supply to the larynx. Patients typically present at birth (or shortly thereafter) with stridor weak or breathy cry dysphonia or aphonia feeding or aspiration difficulties and occasionally respiratory compromise. Neurological disease masses that cause compression and aberrant vessels are often associated. Most cases resolve spontaneously over 6-12 months."
