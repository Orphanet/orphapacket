            "Contents": "A rare structural developmental eye defect characterized by a persistent cyst replacing the eye due to partial or complete failure of the invagination of the optic vesicle during the fetal period. If the failure of invagination is only partial dysplastic ocular structures may be present. The wall of the cyst is composed of connective tissue lined by neuroglial material. The defect is usually unilateral and may be an isolated finding or occur in association with intra- or extraocular malformations."
