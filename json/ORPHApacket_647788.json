Clinical symptoms are evident from early infancy. Majority of the patients also present with behavioral abnormalities (including autistic features aggressive behavior low frustration tolerance and stereotypies such as hand-flapping). Additional clinical features may include inability to walk seizures hearing loss sleep abnormalities joint hyperlaxity. Nonspecific dysmorphic facial features (small head strabismus epicanthal folds synophrys high palate low-set ears orofacial hypotonia full eyelids and eversion of the lower lip) may also be present."
