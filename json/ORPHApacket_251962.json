            "Contents": "A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by a supratentorial space-occupying lesion in periventricular location often with prominent cystic change. The histological hallmark of this low-grade neoplasm is its pseudopapillary appearance with a single layer of cuboidal cells around hyalinized blood vessels associated with sheets or focal collections of neuronal cells. Clinical presentation is variable and non-specific most frequently with headache and seizures. Prognosis is favorable after complete resection."
