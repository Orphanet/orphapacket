            "Contents": "A rare mycosis characterized by granulomatous inflammation primarily of the lung after inhalation of spores of <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>. The severity of clinical disease depends on the immune status of the individual and the size of the inoculum. In immunocompetent persons the infection usually takes a self-limiting and asymptomatic or relatively mild flu-like course. In immunocompromised patients it can become progressive and disseminated involving multiple organs and presenting with fever pneumonia hepatosplenomegaly skin infiltrates and endocarditis among others."
