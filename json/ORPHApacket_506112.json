            "Contents": "A rare neuroendocrine neoplasm of pancreas characterized by morphologically recognizable neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components each constituting at least 30% of the tumor volume. Based on histopathology mixed ductal- and mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas are distinguished. Patients usually present with unspecific symptoms related to tumor growth and/or metastasis although occurrence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has been reported. Resectability of the tumor is the most important prognostic factor."
