The group encompasses (idiopathic) acquired sideroblastic anemia and constitutional sideroblastic anemias. The latter include syndromic sideroblastic anemias such as Pearson syndrome mitochondrial mypathy and sideroblastic anemias x-linked sideroblastic anemia-ataxia thiamine responsive megaloblastic anemia syndrome and nonsyndromic sideroblastic anemias comprising x-linked and autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemias."
