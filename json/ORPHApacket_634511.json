            "Contents": "A rare mosaic form of Legius syndrome characterized by findings typical of Legius syndrome namely multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait macules (CALMs) with or without axillary or inguinal freckling. Mosaic form is caused by postzygotic pathogenic variants in SPRED1 gene. In mosaic Legius syndrome the allelic/tissue distribution of the pathogenic SPRED1-variant clearly suggests mosaicsm and/or the distribution of CALMs is segmental. The phenotype can be milder than in Legius syndrome."
