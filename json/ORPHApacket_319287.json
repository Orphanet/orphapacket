            "Contents": "Multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential is a rare subtype of clear cell renal cell carcinoma with distinct pathological features of cysts lined by occasionally flattened cuboidal clear cells and septa containing aggregates of epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and excellent prognosis. The tumor usually presents as an asymptomatic unilateral solitary lesion macroscopically consisting of numerous fluid-filled septated cysts of variable size. Rarely the symptoms typically associated with renal tumors (flank pain hematuria palpable mass) may be present."
