Even though clinical manifestations are significantly variable among patients most patients manifest dysmorphic facial features (could sometimes include macrocephaly) congenital heart defects hypotonia and opthalmologic abnormalities. Other clinical features may include brain structure anomalies skeletal anomalies hearing impairment and hypogonadism (only in males)."
