Patients present with slowly progressive shortness of breath on exertion and chronic cough with bilateral crackles. Digital clubbing is also frequently observed. Pulmonary function test reveals a restrictive pattern. Computed tomography typically shows diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural and lower zone predominance."
