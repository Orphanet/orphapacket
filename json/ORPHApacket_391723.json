Clinically it presents as acute appendicitis (with abdominal pain fever leukocytosis) or as pseudomyxoma peritonei (wide-spread presence of mucin within the peritoneal cavity) however some patients may be completely asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In many cases a second gastrointestinal malignancy is present."
