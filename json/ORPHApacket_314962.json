            "Contents": "A rare hypereosinophilic syndrome characterized by hypereosinophilia produced by reactive/non-clonal eosinophils secondary to an underlying medical condition and persisting for at least six months. The disorder can derive from non-neoplastic conditions (such as chronic infections and infestations allergic reactions intoxications or autoimmune and chronic inflammatory disorders) or from neoplasms including non-myeloid malignancies among others. It is associated with signs of organ infiltration dysfunction and damage. Clinical manifestations are highly variable depending on the organ systems involved and most commonly include dermatologic pulmonary cardiac gastrointestinal and cerebral manifestations."
