Bone marrow typically shows small hypolobated megakaryocytes and multilineage dyslplasia. Patients typically present with leukocytosis anemia variable platelet counts and a variety of nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding bruising recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement (gingivitis splenomegaly). High resistance to conventional chemotherapy is reported."
