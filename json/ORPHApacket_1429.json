Additional variable manifestations include hypotonia often resulting in psychomotor delay (including gait disturbances) and dysarthria as well as myoclonus dystonia behavioral symptoms (ADHD obsessive-compulsive disorder) learning difficulties (particularly in writing) and spasticity with hyperreflexia and/or flexor/extensor plantar reflexes."
