Patients are at risk of developing neonatal jaundice (potentially leading to kernicterus) gallstones and reticulocytosis and splenomegaly. They have an increased susceptibility to oxidizing agents provoking episodes of acute hemolysis. Favism which describes the occurrence of an acute hemolytic reaction in response to the ingestion of fava beans is more common in infants and young children."
