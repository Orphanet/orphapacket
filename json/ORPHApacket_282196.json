Autoimmunity is typically directed against different target antigens in different tissues. The two more common autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) APS type 1 and type 2 have a strong genetic background and have Addison's disease as a major feature. The group furthermore includes APS type 3 and type 4."
