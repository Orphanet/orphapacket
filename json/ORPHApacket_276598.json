Pancreatic involvement is focal and can be cured by a selective partial pancreatectomy. Hypoglycemia may lead to variable clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic hypoglycemia revealed by routine blood glucose monitoring to macrosomia at birth mild to moderate hepatomegaly and life-threatening hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus further leading to poor neurological outcome."
