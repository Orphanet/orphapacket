            "Contents": "Nevus of Ito is a benign dermal melanocytosis occurring most frequently in the Asian populations and characterized by unilateral asymptomatic blue gray or brown skin pigmentation within the acromioclavicular and upper chest area (involving the side of the neck the supraclavicular and scapular areas and the shoulder region). It is usually diagnosed in early infancy and in early adolescence. Nevus of Ito may progressively enlarge and darken in color (particularly with puberty) and its appearance usually remains stable once adulthood is reached. Spontaneous regression does not occur. Malignant melanoma has rarely been reported within a nevus of Ito. It shares the clinical features of nevus of Ota except its anatomic location and in rare occasions mayoccur together with the latter."
