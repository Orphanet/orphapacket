Histological subtypes include keratinizing non-keratinizing basaloid warty and verrucous carcinomas. Some tumors are associated with human papilloma virus smoking high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion chronic vulvar inflammatory disorders or differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. Patients may present with discharge bleeding or pain. Most important prognostic features are tumor depth and lymph node status."
