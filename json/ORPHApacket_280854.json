The lesions have intracystic communications can be connected to the tracheobronchial tree and are usually unilateral involving a single lobe. Patients present with respiratory distress or respiratory infections in the neonatal period or in infancy. The condition is often associated with tension pneumothorax signs of mediastinal shift and malignant transformation to pleuropulmonary blastoma type 1."
