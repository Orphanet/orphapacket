Other possible causes of joint inflammation must be excluded. Two subgroups of the disease can be distinguished based on the presence of absence of rheumatoid factor. Both subgroups are more common in girls and may be associated with mild fever weight loss anemia moderate hepatosplenomegaly and mild growth retardation."
