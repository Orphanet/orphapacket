Affected individuals present with severe neurological complications following minor trauma due to cervical instability including quadriparesis brisk reflexes clonus spasticity bulbar palsy and seizures. Additional clinical features may include mild joint laxity short clubbed fingers wasting of small hand muscles tongue fasciculations and progressive breathing difficulty. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1994."
