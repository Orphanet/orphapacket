Patients have poor overall growth with severe feeding difficulties associated with gastrointestinal anomalies (including gastroesophageal reflux midgut malrotation). Secretory dysfunction (including tear sweat and saliva production) causing dry mouth and recurrent bronchial mucus plugging are commonly observed. Differing from other form of the syndrome these patients are often present with mild and non specific dysmorphic features (narrow forehead oblong face low-set ears wide mouth mandibular prognathia) and have multiple malformations (gastrointestinal brain choanal)."
