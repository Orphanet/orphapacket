            "Contents": "A rare indolent primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma characterized by multifocal red to violaceous papules plaques or nodules localized predominantly on the trunk and extremities. Histologically these are dermis infiltrates consisting of small marginal zone B cells lymphoplasmacytic cells and plasma cells. Marginal zone B cells express CD20 CD79a and Bcl-2 and are negative for CD5 CD10 and Bcl-6. Plasma cells are typically located at the periphery and express CD138 CD79a and monotypic light chains."
