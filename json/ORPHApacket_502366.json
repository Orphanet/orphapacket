Patients present with a usually asymptomatic lesion of variable appearance such as ulceration a focus of whitish thickening a dry atrophic area or an area of persistent chapping and localized flaking and crusting. Carcinomas of the lower lip tend to progress slowly (as opposed to those of the upper lip). Invasion of adjacent structures including perineural spread is typical with a variable rate of metastasis depending on the location."
