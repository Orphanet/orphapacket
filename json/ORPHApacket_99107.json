            "Contents": "A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by an abnormal protrusion of the interatrial septum into the right or left atrium or both during the cardiorespiratory cycle. The defect may be limited to the fossa ovalis or involve the entire septum. It can present as an isolated finding but is more often associated with interatrial shunts in particular patent foramen ovale. Clinically it increases the risk of peripheral arterial embolism and stroke."
