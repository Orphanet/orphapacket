            "Contents": "A rare autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by childhood to adult onset of slowly progressive limb girdle muscular weakness often accompanied by calf hypertrophy and moderately elevated creatine kinase levels. Patients remain ambulatory but may variably present mild intellectual disability seizures migraine or cardiopulmonary involvement. Occurrence of dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported. Brain MRI typically shows hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences. Muscle biopsy commonly reveals dystrophic features."
