Patients remain ambulatory but may variably present mild intellectual disability seizures migraine or cardiopulmonary involvement. Occurrence of dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported. Brain MRI typically shows hyperintensity in T2-weighted sequences. Muscle biopsy commonly reveals dystrophic features."
