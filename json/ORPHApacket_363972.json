The Noonan-like (NS) phenotype includes dysmorphic facial features (i.e. high forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures ptosis low-set ears prominent philtrum and short neck with or without pterygium colli) developmental delay hypotonia and small head circumference. It can be associated with congenital heart defects or cardiomyopathy ectodermal anomalies and short stature. The NS phenotype is subtle or even inapparent in a large proportion of subjects but may occasionally be severe. Leukemia can be the only clinical manifestation of the syndrome."
