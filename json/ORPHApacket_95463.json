            "Contents": "A group of rare congenital tricuspid malformations characterized by anomalies of the chordae tendineae and papillary muscles including aberrant chordae tendineae straddling valve (abnormal attachment of the chordae tendineae to both ventricles) and parachute valve (unifocal attachment of the chordae tendineae to a single or fused papillary muscle) resulting in an incompetent valve with regurgitation and/or stenosis and impaired right ventricular inflow potentially leading to heart failure. In most cases other cardiac anomalies are found in association."
