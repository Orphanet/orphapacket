Spontaneous hemorrhages do not occur. Patients may be also labeled as having mild hemophilia A if they have a FVIII >40 IU/dL and a DNA change in the F8 gene and one of the following: (i) a family member with the same DNA change and FVIII of <40 IU/dL and the DNA change is found in <1% of the population; and (ii) the international databases list the DNA change as being associated with hemophilia A and <40 IU/dL FVIII. The condition may affect males and female carriers of disease-causing mutations."
