Neurologic deficits depend on the affected segments and the functioning of the residual spinal cord. Typically the spinal cord appears normal above the defect and bulky thickened and low-lying caudally. Clinical presentation includes varying degrees of motor weakness (associated with deformities of the lower limbs) and neurogenic bladder dysfunction."
