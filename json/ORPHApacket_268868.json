            "Contents": "A rare central nervous system malformation characterized by congenital absence of the spinal cord usually associated with segmental bony spinal anomalies. Neurologic deficits depend on the affected segments and the functioning of the residual spinal cord. Typically the spinal cord appears normal above the defect and bulky thickened and low-lying caudally. Clinical presentation includes varying degrees of motor weakness (associated with deformities of the lower limbs) and neurogenic bladder dysfunction."
