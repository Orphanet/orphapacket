It has a highly variable phenotype principally characterized by psychomotor and language delay seizures and dysmorphic features such as high forehead with frontal bossing hypertelorism prominent glabella long narrow palpebral fissures low set ears and short neck. Eye abnormalities (glaucoma irregular iris pigmentation hyperopia) have also been reported."
