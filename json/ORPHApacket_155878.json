            "Contents": "A rare form of cleft palate characterized by congenital muscular diastasis of the soft palate along the midline with an intact oral and nasal mucosal lining. It is diagnosed by the triad of a bifid uvula a translucent zone in the soft palate and a bony notch in the posterior edge of the hard palate all of which may vary in severity. Velopharyngeal insufficiency in the absence of this triad is classified as occult submucosal cleft palate. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with early feeding problems with fluid reflux through the nose speech problems recurrent otitis media with effusions and hearing loss."
