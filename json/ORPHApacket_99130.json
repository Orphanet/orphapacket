            "Contents": "Congenital partial agenesis of pericardium is a rare mostly asymptomatic congenital heart malformation mainly characterized by the partial absence of the left pericardium. It is occasionally associated with chest pain or dyspnea and is usually incidentally diagnosed during surgery or at autopsy. Herniation and strangulation of a portion of the heart through the pericardial foramen may occur resulting in myocardial acute ischemia and possible sudden death. Right side pericardium involvement is rare."
