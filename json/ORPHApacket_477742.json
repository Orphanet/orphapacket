Upper extremities trunk and head and neck are most frequently affected. The lesion typically grows rapidly and almost always measures less than five centimeters in diameter. Macroscopically it may appear circumscribed or infiltrative but is not encapsulated. Recurrence after excision is very rare and metastasis does not occur."
