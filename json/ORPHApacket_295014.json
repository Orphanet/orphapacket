            "Contents": "Familial isolated clinodactyly of fingers is a rare genetic non-syndromic congenital limb malformation disorder characterized by angulation of a digit in the radio-ulnar (coronal) plane away from the axis of joint flexion-extension in several members of a single family with no other associated manifestations. Deviation is usually bilateral and commonly involves the fifth finger. Affected digits present trapezoidal or delta-shaped phalanges on imaging."
