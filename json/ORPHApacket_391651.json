The tumors most often arise in the skin or soft tissues of the distal extremities in particular the subungual region but have been reported in almost any location. They occur as typical glomus tumors glomangiomatosis (multiple nodules of solid glomus tumor investing the vascular walls) symplastic (showing striking nuclear atypia without mitotic activity or necrosis) or malignant glomus tumors and glomus tumors of uncertain malignant potential."
