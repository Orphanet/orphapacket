Patients present a firm slow-growing mass which contains skin and dermal elements (including hair follicles and sebaceous glands) that do not transilluminate or compress and may be associated with intermittent or chronic discharge of sebaceous material soft tissue and skeletal deformity and local infection. Meningitis convulsions and cerebral abscess may be observed if intracranial extension exists."
