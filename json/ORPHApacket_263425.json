            "Contents": "Nevus of Ota is an oculodermal melanocytosis more commonly found in Asian and African populations usually present at birth and characterized by a usually unilateral bluish gray patchy speckled pigmentation (that may progressively enlarge and darken) affecting the skin of the face along the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve (periorbital region temple forehead malar area nose). In 2/3 cases the ipsilateral sclera is affected. Nevus of Ota usually remains stable once adulthood is reached but an increased risk of glaucoma and uveal melanoma may be observed. Extracutaneous lesions may also occur in cornea retina tympanum nasal mucosa pharynx palate. Nevus of Ota occurs as solitary conditions but seldom may occur together with the nevus of Ito or nevus spilus."
