Iodine deficiency is associated with goiter and hypothyroidism. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during pregnancy it is associated with congenital hypothyroidism that is manifested by increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction hyperactivity attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature. Excessive iodine ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy can result in hypothyroidism and fetal goiter due to a prolonged inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis an increase in thyrotropin (TSH)."
