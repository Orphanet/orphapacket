Radiographs from affected individuals may manifest features typical of Desbuquois dysplasia including irregularly shaped capital femoral epiphyses a short femoral neck (resembles the ''Swedish key'' appearance of the proximal femur) and advanced carpal ossification in the hands. However some other features typical of Desbuquois dysplasia like joint dislocations scoliosis coronal clefts or other hand anomalies including accessory ossification centers and/or delta phalanx are not observed. Anterior wedging of vertebral bodies small epiphyses at the knees with metaphyseal flare may be present. Patients have normal metacarpal and phalangeal lengths no distinctive facies nor neurologic complications."
