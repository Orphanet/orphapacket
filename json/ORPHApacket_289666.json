The tumor may occur in the oral cavity the gastrointestinal tract or other predominantly extranodal sites and is typically associated with immunodeficiency or -suppression. The tumor cells are EBV-positive in most cases. Patients often present with disseminated bone involvement. Paraproteinemia may also be detected. Prognosis is generally poor."
