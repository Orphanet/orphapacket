            "Contents": "A very rare form of composite dysraphism characterized by the presence of a split cord malformation and a myeloschisis on one of the two hemicords. Hemicords can be in a single dural sac or in two separated dural sacs. Other spinal cord malformations can be associated. Due to the comparable prognosis it is considered as a subtype of myeloschisis."
