The diagnosis relies on immunophenotyping the T-cell component being characterized by strong expression of cytoplasmic CD3 usually in the absence of surface CD3 the B-cell component expressing CD19 almost always together with CD10 cCD79a CD22 or PAX5 while the most specific hallmark of the myeloid component is the presence of myeloperoxidase in the blast cytoplasm."
