Patients present rapidly progressive cognitive impairment as well as myoclonus visual or cerebellar problems pyramidal or extrapyramidal features and/or akinetic mutism. EEG examination may show characteristic generalized periodic sharp wave complexes. Neuropathologic analysis reveals spongiform change neuronal loss and gliosis and deposition of abnormal prion protein."
