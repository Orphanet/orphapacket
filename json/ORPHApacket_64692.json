            "Contents": "A rare bacterial infectious disease transmitted between humans via bites from infected sand flies in high-altitude valleys of the South American Andes characterized by two disparate syndromes which can arise independently or sequentially. The first Oroya fever occurs about 60 days after the fly bite as a severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality in untreated individuals. The second chronic phase termed verruga peruana can persist for months or years and manifests with endothelial cell-derived blood-filled tumors developing on the surface of the skin."
