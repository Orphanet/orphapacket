            "Contents": "A rare non-infectious posterior uveitis characterized by usually bilateral chronic progressive recurrent inflammation of the choroid retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. In the classic or peripapillary geographic type of the disease infiltrates originating in the peripapillary region progress in an irregular serpentine fashion centrifugally and resolve spontaneously after several weeks leaving atrophic scars. Multiple recurrences often with months to years of quiescence in between result in progressive visual loss in one or both eyes."
