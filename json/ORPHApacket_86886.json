The spleen liver skin and bone marrow are also frequently involved. Patients typically present with generalized lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly systemic symptoms and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Pruritic skin rash arthritis pleural effusion and ascites may also be observed. The condition is aggressive with generally poor prognosis."
