Emphysema is usually encountered in the upper lobes preceding fibrosis of the lower lobes. Patients present with severe dyspnea and markedly reduced diffusion capacity on functional testing while spirometric values are relatively preserved. The syndrome is frequently complicated by pulmonary hypertension and acute lung injury."
