            "Contents": "Fetal carbamazepine syndrome is a drug-related embryofetopathy that can occur when an embryo/fetus is exposed to carbamazepine and that is characterized by facial dysmorphism with some similarities to that seen in fetal valproate syndrome such as epicanthal folds upward slanting palpebral fissures short nose micrognathia and malar hypoplasia as well as nail dysplasia and major anomalies including cleft lip/palate neural tube defects and cardiac anomalies. <i>In utero</i> exposure to carbamazepine in combination with valproate has been associated with significant developmental delay (particularly affecting verbal intelligence) and a high rate of congenital anomalies."
