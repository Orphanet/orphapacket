Patients present with predominantly cutaneous manifestations consisting of yellowish papules which coalesce into large plaques and are most commonly localized on the neck axillae groin and flexural surfaces. Skin biopsy shows accumulation of clumped calcified elastic fibers in the mid-dermis. Reported underlying factors include previous liver transplantation exposure to penicillamine or concomitant beta-thalassemia."
