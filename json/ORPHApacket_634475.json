            "Contents": "A rare mosaic form of NF2-related schwannomatosis characterized by findings typical of NF2-related schwannomatosis namely development of multiple benign nerve sheath tumors called schwannomas particularly affecting the vestibular nerve. Mosaic form is caused by postzygotic pathogenic variants in NF2. In mosaic NF2-related schwannomatosis the allelic/tissue distribution of the pathogenic NF2 variant clearly suggests mosaicism. The phenotype can be milder than in NF2-related schwannomatosis."
