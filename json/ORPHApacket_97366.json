The tumor is surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule and does not contain solid areas or necrosis. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with a palpable abdominal mass and/or abdominal or flank pain. Age distribution is bimodal the typical age of onset being either below five or between 40 and 70 years of age."
