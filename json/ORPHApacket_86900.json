Solitary lymph node involvement is common although extranodal localization (in particular skin and soft tissue) has also been reported. Patients usually present with an asymptomatic mass sometimes with systemic symptoms such as fatigue fever and night sweats. Generalized lymphadenopathy splenomegaly or hepatomegaly may be seen in rare cases. The clinical course is generally aggressive."
