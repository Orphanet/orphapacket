Dysmorphic facial features may include microcephaly (or sometimes macrocephaly) a round face a flat head with a shortened forehead hypertelorism upslanted palpebral fissures bulbous nose wide nasal bridge short philtrum tented upper lip and dental abnormalities (most commonly retained primary teeth). Additional clinical features can include recurrent infections cyclic vomiting syndrome seizures and nonspecific congenital malformations."
