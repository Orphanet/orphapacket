Median motor nerve conduction velocities are typically less than 38 m/s. Patients often have foot deformities. Sural nerve biopsy shows decrease in myelinated fibers myelin abnormalities and onion bulb formation. Fatty replacement of muscle tissue predominantly affects the anterior and lateral compartment of the lower legs."
