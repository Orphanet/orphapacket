Histopathologically the lesion is well-circumscribed lobulated and composed of epitheloid ovoid or spindle cells arranged in a nodular and often syncytial pattern with pseudoangiomatoid spaces and a peripheral fibrous pseudocapsule with a prominent lymphoplasmacytic cuff. The tumor is most common in the first two decades of life and usually follows an indolent course although local recurrence may occur while metastasis is rare."
