Loss of less than 50% of interlobular bile ducts is associated with a mild disease course while loss of the majority of ducts results in a severe form potentially leading to cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients typically present as young or middle-aged adults with episodic jaundice pruritus and elevated liver enzymes."
