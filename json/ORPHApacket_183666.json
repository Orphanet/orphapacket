Autoimmune manifestations (including immune cytopenias arthritis and hepatitis) are occasionally associated. Immunologic findings reveal absent immunoglobulin class switch recombination and lack of defect of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutations in the presence of normal numbers of CD27+ memory B cells."
