            "Contents": "An intermediate form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis spectrum characterized by destruction and detachment of the skin epithelium involving between 10 to 29% of the body surface area and mucous membranes. Onset usually occurs 4-28 days after administration of the causal medication and is most frequently associated with anticonvulsants antibacterial sulfonamides allopurinol nevirapine and oxicams (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) but many other medications have also been implicated. The disease is not induced by medication in 15% of cases. Histology is characterized by an epidermal necrolysis. Multiple disabling long-term sequelae (especially cutaneous ocular and psychological) are frequent."
