            "Contents": "A rare malignant neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation of myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring rearrangements in the PDGFRA gene in the blood bone marrow and often other tissues as well (spleen lymph nodes skin etc.). It usually presents as chronic eosinophilic leukemia or less commonly as acute myeloid leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia. Patients usually present with eosinophilia anemia thrombocytopenia neutrophilia splenomegaly lymphadenopathy fever sweating and/or weight loss. Tissue infiltration by eosinophils can manifest with skin rash erythema cough neurological alterations gastrointestinal symptoms or rarely endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive cardiomyopathy."
