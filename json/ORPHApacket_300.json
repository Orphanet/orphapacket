Types 1-3 are typically fatal in infancy. Patients present with early onset of generalized hypotonia seizures severe global developmental delay craniofacial dysmorphism (large fontanel high forehead hypertelorism epicanthal folds) and elevated plasma very long chain fatty acids. Variable features include hepatomegaly polymicrogyria and cerebral white matter abnormalities among others."
