Patients also present intrauterine growth retardation facial dysmorphism (flat facial profile low-set ears shallow orbits short and upturned nose downturned corners of mouth) and joint flexion contractures. Growth and developmental delay bilateral sensorineural deafness friable diaphragm and later-onset spontaneous vascular ruptures are additional reported features."
