The disease is usually bilateral. Rarely nystagmus can be absent. Locally the disease is characterized by underdeveloped foveal pit absence of foveal pigmentation and/or foveal avascular zone and persistence of inner retinal layers at the fovea in absence of concomitant ocular or systemic pathology."
