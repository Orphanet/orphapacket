It usually presents as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with eosinophilia chronic eosinophilic leukemia atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients usually present with anemia leukocytosis monocytosis eosinophilia and/or splenomegaly or systemic symptoms such as fever sweating and/or weight loss."
