Patients may present with the appearance of the forearm directly attached to the shoulder no articulation at the shoulder joint impossible passive extension of the arm beyond the mid-axillary line no elbow joints bowing of the radius a short ulna and/or ulnar/radial deviation of the hand at the wrist."
