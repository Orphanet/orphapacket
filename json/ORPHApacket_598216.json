            "Contents": "A rare urinary tract tumor characterized by a malignant neoplasm arising from urothelial cells of the pyelocaliceal cavities and ureter. The tumor may be multifocal and bilateral in some cases and is more common in males than in females. Cigarette smoking and occupational exposure are major risk factors. Patients most commonly present with visible or non-visible hematuria and/or flank pain due to obstruction of the flow of urine by tumor tissue or (less often) to local tumor growth. Systemic symptoms such as anorexia weight loss malaise fatigue fever night sweats or cough can be associated with advanced stages."
