Depending on the primary localization and the size of the tumor patients can present with signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache vomiting papilledema) blurred vision decreased visual acuity ataxia and/or nystagmus among others. It is most commonly located in the cerebellum but ocurrence in the hypothalamus brain stem optic chiasma and hemispheres has also been reported."
