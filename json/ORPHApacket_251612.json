This WHO grade 1 tumor is most often located in the cerebellum in children or in the hypothalamus brain stem optic chiasma and brain hemispheres in adults. Depending on the primary location and the growth rate of the tumor patients may present with signs of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurological signs such as decreased visual acuity ataxia and/or nystagmus among other symptoms. Molecularly it exhibits alterations in genes of the MAPK signaling pathway most commonly <i>KIAA1549::BRAF</i> fusion."
