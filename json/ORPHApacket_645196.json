            "Contents": "A rare dysraphic abnormality characterized by a persistent connection between the neural tissue and overlying skin. The stalk-like connection consists of a fibroneural tract (mainly composed of fibrous attenuated mesenchymal tissue and neural elements without an epithelial lining) connecting the skin lesion to the underlying dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Fibroneural stalk varies in thickness and complexity and they pass through the deep fascia a bifid lamina/ the interspinous ligament and the dura. It can be associated with filum anomaly. Chiari II malformation is not present."
