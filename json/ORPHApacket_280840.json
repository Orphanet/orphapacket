The lesions have intracystic communications can be connected to the tracheobronchial tree and are usually unilateral involving a single lobe. The condition often presents with respiratory distress in the neonatal period or in infancy. It is frequently associated with other severe congenital anomalies such as renal agenesis or dysgenesis pulmonary sequestration or cardiac abnormalities."
