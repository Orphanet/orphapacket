It can occur either as a primary neoplasm or secondary to previous chemo-/radiation therapy. Clinical manifestations result from accumulation of malignant myeloid cells within the bone marrow peripheral blood and other organs and include leukocytosis anemia thrombocytopenia fever bone pain fatigue pallor easy bruising and frequent bleeding."
