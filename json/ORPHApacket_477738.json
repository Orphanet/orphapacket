Pediatric MS patients present a predominantly relapsing-remitting course with first attack usually consisting of optic neuritis transverse myelitis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits. A high burden of T2-hyperintense lesions on initial MRI primarily of the supratentorial region and/or of the cervical spinal cord has been reported."
