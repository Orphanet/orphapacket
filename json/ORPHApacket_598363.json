The primary infection is typically mild or asymptomatic and patients are generally previously healthy individuals. Typical presenting signs and symptoms are persistent fever gastrointestinal symptoms mucocutaneous inflammation lymphopenia and high levels of circulating inflammatory markers. Some patients develop severe disease with cardiac involvement hypotension and shock.
