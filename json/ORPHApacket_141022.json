Second branchial cleft fistulae and sinuses present with skin opening with chronic discharge and recurrent infections whereas second branchial cleft cysts present as a painless nontender stable in size or slowly enlarging lateral neck masses. Cysts occasionally acutely increase in size during upper respiratory tract infection leading to respiratory compromise torticollis and dysphagia."
