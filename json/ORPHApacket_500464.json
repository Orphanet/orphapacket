Patients may present with nasal obstruction epistaxis rhinorrhea swelling or (at more advances stages) with facial pain and/or paralysis diplopia and proptosis. Patients with paranasal sinus tumors present later and at a higher stage than patients with nasal cavity carcinomas. Risk factors are smoking and industrial exposures. High-risk HPV is most frequently associated with the non-keratinizing type."
