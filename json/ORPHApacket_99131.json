On occasion it manifests with chest pain dyspnea tachycardia persistent cough or cardiac arrhythmias. The condition is usually benign but rare complications such as cardiac tamponade cardiogenic shock mitral valve prolapse hoarseness atrial fibrillation right ventricular outflow tract obstruction spontaneous internal hemorrhage pulmonary stenosis and sudden death may occur."
