The category includes double-hit cases with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma blastoid cases with a double-hit and cases with a DLBCL not otherwise specified morphology with a double-hit. It refers only to <i>de novo</i> cases not to lymphomas with a history of pre-existing or coexistent indolent lymphoma. Patients typically present with widespread disease including involvement of lymph nodes bone marrow and central nervous system."
