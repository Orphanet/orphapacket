            "Contents": "A rare hepatic tumor characterized by the presence of both hepatocytic and cholangiocytic differentiation within a primary liver carcinoma. The lesion commonly arises in the context of chronic liver disease (such as hepatitis B or C or steatohepatitis) or exposure to a variety of exogenous agents. Patients may present with signs and symptoms related to the tumor as well as to the underlying condition. Typical manifestations include right upper quadrant abdominal pain weight loss hepatosplenomegaly jaundice and ascites. The entity has been associated with a worse prognosis than hepatocellular carcinoma after resection."
