In a systematic study of coarctation familial aggregation was considered as result of multifactorial inheritance and recurrence risks in sibs was evaluated at about 0.5% for coarctation and 1.0% for any form of congenital heart defect. Nevertheless in some of the described families aortic coarctations seems to be inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation."
