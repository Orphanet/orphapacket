Bone marrow biopsy reveals the presence of monoclonal mast cells carrying the <i>KIT</i> D816V mutation and/or expressing CD25. Patients present with recurrent episodes of flushing headache hypotension abdominal cramping nausea diarrhea cardiac arrhythmias bronchoconstriction and bleeding diathesis among others."
