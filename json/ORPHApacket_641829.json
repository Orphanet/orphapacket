            "Contents": "A rare non-inflammatory vasculopathy characterized by intracompartmental pressure typically in a distal upper extremity due to intrauterine ischemia and external compression. Affected limb presents significant swelling and sentinel skin changes (desquamation blister/bullae formation and skin necrosis). It can lead to long-term sequelae including Volkmann contracture limb length discrepancies,bone growth abnormalities and nerve lesions. Neurologic involvement ranging from sensory and motor nerve palsies to complete hand paralysis may persist."
