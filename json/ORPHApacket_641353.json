Most patients manifest global developmental delay moderate to severe intellectual disability and white matter abnormalities in infancy complicated by variable features including seizures episodic respiratory failure joint contractures and ocular problems. Some patients have normal early development until later childhood followed by regression in motor cognitive and language skills over time. Some patients manifest only spastic paraplegia."
