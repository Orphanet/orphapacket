Hair is characterized by a banded or speckled appearance due to alternating light bands (corresponding to air-filled cavities within the cortex of the affected hair shafts) and dark bands. The bands have a lifelong duration may only be detectable under light microscopy are more apparent in fair-colored hair or with age-related graying and have no effect on hair growth or fragility in the vast majority of cases."
