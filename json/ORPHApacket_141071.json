            "Contents": "Digestive duplication cyst of the tongue is an extremely rare otorhinolaryngological malformation which occurs during early embryogenesis and is characterized by a single and on occasion multiple cystic lesion that is most frequently located in the anterior portion of the tongue either deeply embedded within it or superficially on it. Depending mostly on size and location of the cyst patients could be asymptomatic or could present a wide array of symptoms such as varying degrees of respiratory and feeding difficulties lingual swelling and protrusion dysphagia and more rarely recurrent bleeding or brownish discharge from a lingual sinus."
