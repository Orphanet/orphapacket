Depending mostly on size and location of the cyst patients could be asymptomatic or could present a wide array of symptoms such as varying degrees of respiratory and feeding difficulties lingual swelling and protrusion dysphagia and more rarely recurrent bleeding or brownish discharge from a lingual sinus."
