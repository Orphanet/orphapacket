            "Contents": "A rare superficial corneal dystrophy characterized by progressive opacity of the most anterior corneal layers. Slit-lamp examination reveals typical confluent translucent subepithelial deposits extending in size and growing into clusters of golden droplets covering the cornea with disease progression. Patients present variably compromised visual acuity depending on the stage of the disease. In advanced stages decreased corneal sensation may lead to corneal trophic changes perforation and permanent visual loss."
