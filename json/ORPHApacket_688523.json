The majority of patients are asymptomatic and the condition is usually discovered incidentally. When patients are symptomatic they may present with dyspnea abdominal pain splenomegaly diarrhea or constipation. Lesions are usually benign with no malignant potential. However very large lesions may require splenectomy due to their increased risk of rupture which may lead to intra-abdominal hemorrhage."
