The diabetes leads to chronic complications involving the retina kidney nerves and cardiovascular system and to liver steatosis that could result in cirrhosis. In some forms lipoatrophy is associated with selective hypertrophy of other fat deposits. Clinical signs of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans and signs of hyperandrogenism) are often present. It has both genetic and acquired forms."
