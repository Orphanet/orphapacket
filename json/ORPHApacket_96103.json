Short stature and seizures as well as cardiac (e.g. atrial septal defect) skeletal (incl. brachy/syndactyly) and genital (e.g. micropenis cryptorchidism) abnormalities may also be associated. Neurodevelopmental anomalies (pain insensitivity sensorineural hearing loss expressive language deficiency) and neuropsychiatric disorders (autistic features auditory hallucination self-talking) have also been reported."
