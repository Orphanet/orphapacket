            "Contents": "A rare common cystic lymphatic malformation characterized by a benign cystic lesion composed of dilated lymphatic channels. Mixed cystic lesions consist of cysts both larger (macrocystic) and smaller (microcystic) than 1 cm in diameter. They usually present at birth or during the first years of life and most often occur in the head and neck region but may affect any site. Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the lesion. Infection trauma or intracystic hemorrhage can lead to lesional expansion. Malignant transformation does not occur."
