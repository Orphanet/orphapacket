            "Contents": "A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy and predominantly follicular or perifollicular growth pattern consistent with the expression of T-follicular helper markers. Affected individuals distinctly lack histologic features (such as proliferation of high endothelial venules and expanded follicular dendritic meshworks) typically associated to angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. It affects elderly individuals (mostly at the sixth decade of life) that present with advanced-stage disease. Majority of the cases have disseminated nodal involvement whereas involvement of extranodal sites including skin liver spleen and bone marrow are also reported. Patients may therefore develop skin rash and immune manifestations."
