  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by global developmental
      delay intellectual disability of varying severity or learning difficulties (e.g.
      dysphasia dyspraxia dyscalculia dysgraphia) and behavioral disorders (stereotypies
      autism spectrum disorder impulsiveness or intolerance to frustration self or
      hetero aggression). Additional clinical features include weight disorders (overweight/obesity)
      and eating behaviour disorders (including hyperphagia tachyphagia obsessive
      food compulsions) non-specific magnetic resonance imaging (brain MRI) abnormalities
      ophthalmologic abnormalities epilepsy sleep disorders and non-specific dysmorphism.
      Endocrine abnormalities are rarely associated.
