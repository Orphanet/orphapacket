    Contents: X-linked intellectual disability-short stature-overweight syndrome is
      a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by borderline to severe
      intellectual disability speech delay short stature elevated body mass index
      a pattern of truncal obesity (reported in older males) and variable neurologic
      features (e.g. hypotonia tremors gait disturbances behavioral problems and seizure
      disorders). Less common manifestations include microcephaly microorchidism and/or
      microphallus. Dysmorphic features have been reported in some patients but no
      consitent pattern has been noted.
