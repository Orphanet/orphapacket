    Contents: A rare hematologic disease characterized by eosinophilia without evidence
      of clonality persisting for at least six months for which no underlying cause
      can be identified. The condition is associated with signs of organ damage and
      dysfunction. Clinical manifestations are highly variable depending on the organ
      systems involved and include rapidly developing life-threatening cardiovascular
      or neurological complications.
