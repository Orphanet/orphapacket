  TextSection:
    Contents: Rigid spine syndrome (RSS) is a slowly progressive childhood-onset congenital
      muscular dystrophy (see this term) characterized by contractures of the spinal
      extensor muscles associated with abnormal posture (limitation of neck and trunk
      flexure) progressive scoliosis of the spine early marked cervico-axial muscle
      weakness with relatively preserved strength and function of the extremities
      and progressive respiratory insufficiency.
