  TextSection:
    Contents: Rigid spine syndrome (RSS) is a slowly progressive childhood-onset congenital
      muscular dystrophy characterized by contractures of the spinal extensor muscles
      associated with abnormal posture (limitation of neck and trunk flexure) progressive
      scoliosis of the spine early marked cervico-axial muscle weakness with relatively
      preserved strength and function of the extremities and progressive respiratory
      insufficiency.
