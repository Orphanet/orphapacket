  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of type 2 von Willebrand disease characterized by a bleeding
      disorder associated with increased affinity of the Willebrand factor (VWF) for
      platelets leading to rapid clearance of both the platelets (increasing the risk
      of thrombocytopenia) and VWF from the plasma. The disease manifests as mucocutaneous
      bleeding (menorrhagia epistaxis gastrointestinal hemorrhage etc.).
