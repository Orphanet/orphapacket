  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of neutral lipid storage disease characterized by the accumulation
      of lipid vacuoles in leukocytes (so-called Jordan's anomaly seen in peripheral
      blood smears) and a variety of other cell types. The clinical picture consists
      of congenital ichthyosis of the congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma type together
      with variable multisystem involvement. Manifestations include hepatosplenomegaly
      myopathy intestinal disease growth retardation cataracts sensorineural hearing
      loss and intellectual disability among others.
