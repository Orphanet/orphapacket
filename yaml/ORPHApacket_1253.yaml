  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare syndrome characterized by a combination of blepharochalasis
      double lip and non-toxic thyroid enlargement (seen in 10-50% of cases) although
      the occurrence of all three signs at presentation is uncommon. Hypertrophy of
      the mucosal zone of the lip with persistence of the horizontal sulcus between
      cutaneous and mucosal zones gives an appearance of double lip with the upper
      lip being frequently involved. Blepharochalasis or episodic edema of eyelid
      appears around puberty is present in 80% of cases is usually bilateral and can
      rarely lead to vision impairment and other ocular complications. Most cases
      are sporadic but familial cases (with a possible autosomal dominant inheritance)
      have also been reported.
