  TextSection:
    Contents: A parasitic disease caused by the protozoa <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>
      mainly occurring in tropical regions after the ingestion of an amoebic cyst
      and resulting in clinical manifestations that may range from an asymptomatic
      state to amoebic colitis (violent abdominal pain a painful contracted feeling
      around the anal sphincter blood and mucus in the stools but without the presence
      of fever) or amoebic liver abscesses (fever chills abdominal pain weight loss
      hepatomegaly) that can be fatal if not immediately treated. Extraintestinal
      involvement elsewhere (i.e. thoracic hepatic) is extremely rare.
