  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive microcephalic primordial dwarfism characterized
      by congenital microcephaly and craniofacial features associated with a spectrum
      of limb abnormalities ranging from mild to severe. Short stature is frequently
      observed and often is severe.
