  TextSection:
    Contents: A hereditary macular disorder usually presenting between the ages of
      30-60 characterized by a large area of atrophy in the centre of the macula and
      the loss or absence of photoreceptors retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris
      in this area resulting in a progressive decrease in visual acuity.
