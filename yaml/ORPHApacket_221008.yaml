  TextSection:
    Contents: Rothmund-Thomson syndrome type 1 is a subform of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome
      (RTS) presenting with a characteristic facial rash (poikiloderma) and frequently
      associated with short stature sparse scalp hair sparse or absent eyelashes and/or
      eyebrows and rapidly progressive bilateral juvenile cataracts. In contrast to
      RTS2 patients with RTS1 do not appear to have an increased risk of developing
      cancer.
