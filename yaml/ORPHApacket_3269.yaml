  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital radioulnar synostosis is a rare bone disorder that may be
      isolated or associated with other disorders and that is characterized by failure
      of segmentation of the radius and ulna during embryological development causing
      limited rotational movements of the forearm which may lead to difficulties with
      some activities of daily living.
