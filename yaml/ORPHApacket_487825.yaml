    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by axial hypotonia after birth prolonged feeding difficulties moderate to severe
      global developmental delay seizures (in particular absence seizures) fetal digital
      pads distinctive plantar fat pads anteromedial to the heels and deep palmar

      high anterior hairline narrow palpebral fissures that take on a crescent moon
      shape when smiling broad nasal bridge and tip with anteverted nostrils mild
      midfacial hypoplasia long smooth philtrum thin upper lip vermillion small widely
      spaced teeth and flat occiput/microcephaly/brachycephaly.
