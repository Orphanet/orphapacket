    Contents: Pierpont syndrome is a rare subcutaneous tissue disorder characterized
      by axial hypotonia after birth prolonged feeding difficulties moderate to severe
      global developmental delay seizures (in particular absence seizures) fetal digital
      pads distinctive plantar fat pads anteromedial to the heels deep palmar and
      plantar grooves. Additionally distinct craniofacial dysmorphic features notably
      a broad face with high forehead high anterior hairline narrow palpebral fissures
      that take on a crescent moon shape when smiling broad nasal bridge and tip with
      anteverted nostrils mild midfacial hypoplasia long smooth philtrum thin upper
      lip vermillion small widely spaced teeth and flat occiput/microcephaly/brachycephaly
      are also chararteristic. Over time fat pads may become less prominent and disappear.
