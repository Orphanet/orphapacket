  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive form of proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA)
      characterized by an isolated defect in the proximal tubule leading to the decreased
      reabsorption of bicarbonate and consequently causing urinary bicarbonate wastage.
      Mild growth retardation and reduced bone density are extra-renal complications.
      Several fractures and delayed puberty are possible features.
