  TextSection:
    Contents: Intraocular medulloepithelioma is a rare eye tumor characterized by
      a white gray or yellow-colored cystic mass that arises from the primitive neuroectodermal
      nonpigmented epithelium of the ciliary body or occasionally from the optic nerve
      optic disc retina or iris. Typically it has a benign clinical course with good
      prognosis and generally presents with childhood onset of poor vision and pain
      glaucoma and/or cataract. Leukocoria exotropia exophthalmos strabismus epiphora
      change in eye color hyphema and raised intraocular pressure are also remarkable
      manifestations.
