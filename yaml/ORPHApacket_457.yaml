  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis characterized at birth
      by the presence of large thick plate-like shell over the whole body associated
      with severe ectropion eclabium and flattened ears that later develops into a
      severe scaling erythroderma. Harlequin ichthyosis is the most severe disorder
      of this group.
