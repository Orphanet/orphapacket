  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic skeletal muscle disease characterized by childhood onset
      of exercise-induced progressive impairment of muscle relaxation stiffness cramps
      and myalgia predominantly in the arms legs and face (eyelids) and biochemically
      by a reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase activity. Symptoms improve
      after a few minutes of rest and may be exacerbated by cold. The term Brody syndrome
      refers to a clinically distinguishable subset of patients without <i>ATP2A1</i>
      mutations with adolescence or adult onset and selective muscular involvement
      in which myalgia is more common.
