  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic human prion disease characterized by adult-onset neurodegenerative
      manifestations associated with a movement disorder and psychiatric/behavioral
      disturbances. Patients typically present personality changes aggressiveness
      manias anxiety and/or depression in conjunction with rapidly progressive cognitive
      decline (presenting with dysarthria apraxia aphasia and eventually leading to
      dementia) as well as ataxia (manifesting with gait disturbances unsteadiness
      coordination problems) Parkinsonism myoclonus and/or chorea. Additional features
      may include generalized spasticity seizures urine incontinence and pyramidal
      abnormalities.
