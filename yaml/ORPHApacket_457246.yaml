  TextSection:
    Contents: Clear cell sarcoma of kidney is a rare primary genetic renal tumor usually
      characterized by a unilateral unicentric morphologically diverse tumor that
      arises from the renal medulla and has a tendency for vascular invasion. Clinically
      it presents with a palpable abdominal mass abdominal or flank pain hematuria
      anemia and/or fatigue. Metastatic spread to lymph nodes bones lungs retroperitoneum
      brain and liver is common at time of diagnosis and therefore bone pain cough
      or neurological compromise may be associated. Metastasis to unusual sites such
      as the scalp neck nasopharynx axilla orbits and epidural space have been reported.
