  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare high-grade endometrial carcinoma characterized by diffuse marked
      nuclear pleomorphism typically exhibiting complex papillary and/or glandular
      growth patterns and showing abnormal p53 and diffuse p16 immunohistochemistry.
      The tumor typically arises in atrophic endometrium or in an endometrial polyp.
      Most patients present with postmenopausal bleeding. Extrauterine metastasis
      is present in 40-50% of surgically staged cases most frequently involving lymph
      nodes or peritoneal sites and omentum. Patients with extrauterine spread have
      poor outcomes while endometrium-limited carcinoma has a better prognosis.
