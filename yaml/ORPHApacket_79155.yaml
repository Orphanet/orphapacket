  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder of tryptophan metabolism characterized by massive
      urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid (XA) 3-hydroxykynurenine and kynurenine
      and increased XA concentration in plasma. The clinical phenotype is highly variable
      ranging from asymptomatic or mild cases presentating with jaundice and vomiting
      with subsequent normal development and growth to more severe cases with manifestions
      which include intellectual disability cerebellar ataxia pellagra progressive
      encephalopathy with muscular hypotonia global developmental delay stereotyped
      gestures and/or congenital deafness.
