  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by chronic eruption of sterile pustules
      on an erythematous and desquamative background. The lesions are usually painful
      and affect the palms and soles sometimes also the lateral aspects of hands and
      feet. Nail lesions (such as nail pitting onycholysis subungual pustules and
      nail dystrophy) are also observed. The condition takes a chronic and relapsing
      course. Typical associations are psoriatic arthritis thyroid gland dysfunction
      and smoking.
