  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary lymphoma of the conjunctiva is an extremely rare clonal lymphoid
      proliferation of the ocular surface with an indolent course. Clinically it presents
      with treatment-resistant conjunctivitis ptosis excessive tear production or
      as a painless salmon-pink ''fleshy'' patch with a smooth or multinodular surface
      on the bulbar conjunctiva. Histologically it is usually B-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      (most often extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma followed by follicular
      and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) with conjunctival T-cell Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
      being very rare.
