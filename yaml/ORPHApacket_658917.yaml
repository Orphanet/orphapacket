  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease characterized by infection with the trematode
      <i>Clonorchis sinensis</i> (Chinese or oriental liver fluke) through ingestion
      of metacercarial cysts via infected raw or undercooked fish. Clinical symptoms
      are related to worm burden. Most acute infections are asymptomatic or present
      with mild abdominal symptoms. Patients with high worm burdens experience fever
      headache right upper-quadrant abdominal pain and intermittent colic pain caused
      by the worms obstructing the gallbladder. Chronic infections are usually severe
      resulting in fibrosis of small bile ducts and destruction of the adjacent liver
      parenchyma and strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma.
