    Contents: A rare genetic or acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized
      by asymptomatic solitary or multiple firm skin-colored to yellowish papules
      or nodules of variable size that are disseminated or grouped in clusters and
      typically located on the trunk buttocks thighs or face among others. Histologically
      focal increase of thickened tortuous elastic fibers in the reticular dermis

      with osteopoikilosis (Buschke-Ollendorf syndrome) may be observed.
