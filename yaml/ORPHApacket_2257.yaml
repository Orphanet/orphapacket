  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary pulmonary hypoplasia is a rare isolated genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis characterized by congenital malformation of pulmonary
      parenchyma with absence of other anomalies. Neonatally patients present with
      decreased breath sounds small lung volume and severe respiratory distress that
      is not responsive to aggressive treatment (including surfactant instillation/
      mechanical respiratory support). It is usually not compatible with life.
