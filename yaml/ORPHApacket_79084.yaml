      \ of familial partial lipodystrophy (FPLD; see this term) of unknown etiology\
      \ characterized by lipoatrophy that is confined to the limbs and a normal or\
      \ increased fat distribution of the face neck and trunk. Arterial hypertension\
      \ and diabetes have also been associated. Inheritance is thought to be autosomal\
      \ dominant."
