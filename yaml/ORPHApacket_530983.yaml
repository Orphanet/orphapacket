  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by global
      developmental delay and speech delay variable degrees of intellectual disability
      and dysmorphic facial features (such as frontal bossing epicanthal folds strabismus
      depressed nasal bridge short philtrum auricular abnormalities micrognathia or
      crowded teeth among others). Additional reported manifestations are behavioral
      problems (stereotypies aggression anxiety autism spectrum disorder) skeletal
