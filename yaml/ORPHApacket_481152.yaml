  TextSection:
    Contents: PYCR2-related microcephaly-progressive leukoencephalopathy is a rare
      genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized by progressive
      postnatal microcephaly cerebral hypomyelination and severe psychomotor developmental
      delayed with absent speech as well as axial hypotonia appendicular hypertonia
      with hyperextensibility of the wrists and ankles hyperreflexia severe muscle
      wasting and failure to thrive. Associated craniofacial dysmorphism includes
      triangular facies with bitemporal narrowing down- or upslanting palpebral fissures
      malar hypoplasia large malformed ears with overfolded helices upturned bulbous
      nose long smooth philtrum and thin vermilion borders.
