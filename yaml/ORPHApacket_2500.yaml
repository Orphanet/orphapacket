  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare premature aging syndrome characterized by atrophy of the skin
      and subcutaneous tissue involving predominantly the distal parts of the extremities
      resulting in prematurely aged appearance of the hand and feet. Another prominent
      feature is the characteristic facies with hollow cheeks beaked nose and owl-like
      eyes. Additional non-dermatological manifestations like bone anomalies have
      been described in some patients. Mode of inheritance has not been definitively
      established.
