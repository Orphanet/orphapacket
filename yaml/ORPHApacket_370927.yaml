  TextSection:
    Contents: SSR4-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by neurologic abnormalities (global developmental delay in language
      social skills and fine and gross motor development intellectual disability hypotonia
      microcephaly seizures/epilepsy) facial dysmorphism (deep set eyes large ears
      hypoplastic vermillion of upper lip large mouth with widely spaced teeth) feeding
      problems often due to chewing difficulties and aversion to food with certain
      textures failure to thrive gastrointestinal abnormalities (reflux or vomiting)
      and strabismus. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene <i> SSR4</i>
      (Xq28).
