  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder caused by infection of the central nervous system by
      Herpes simplex virus (HSV) that could have a devastating clinical course and
      a potentially fatal outcome particularly with delay or lack of treatment. This
      disorder often involves the frontal and temporal lobes usually asymmetrically
      resulting in personality changes cognitive impairment aphasia seizures and focal
      weakness.
