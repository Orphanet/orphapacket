  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic amyloidosis characterized by a triad of ophthalmologic
      neurologic and dermatologic findings due to the deposition of gelsolin amyloid
      fibrils in these tissues. Clinical manifestations include corneal lattice dystrophy
      cranial neuropathy especially affecting the facial nerve bulbar signs cutis
      laxa increased skin fragility and less commonly peripheral neuropathy and renal
      failure.
