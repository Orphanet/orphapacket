  TextSection:
    Contents: Recessive intellectual disability-motor dysfunction-multiple joint contractures
      syndrome is a rare genetic syndromic intellectual disabilty disorder characterized
      by severe intellectual disability progressive postnatal multiple joint contractures
      and severe motor dysfunction. Patients present arrest and regression of motor
      function and speech acquisition as well as contractures which begin in lower
      limbs and slowly progress in an ascending manner to include spine and neck resulting
      in individuals presenting a specific fixed position.
