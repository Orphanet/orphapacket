  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare radiation-induced disorder resulting from whole body exposure
      to large doses of penetrating radiation (>0.7 Gray) within a very short period
      of time (usually minutes) and characterized by bone marrow syndrome with pancytopenia
      (mild symptoms of which may occur already at 0.3 Gray) gastrointestinal syndrome
      resulting in mostly fatal infection dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (occurring
      at doses >10 Gray) and cardiovascular/central nervous system syndrome with watery
      diarrhea convulsions coma and death within three days of exposure (occurring
      at doses >50 Gray). The syndrome develops in four clinical stages (prodromal/latent/manifest
      illness/recovery or death) of variable duration.
