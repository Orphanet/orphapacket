    Contents: A rare genetic retinal disorder characterized by childhood-onset of
      markedly delayed visual adaptation to both dark and light conditions marked
      difficulties tracking moving objects and mild photophobia. Visual acuity is
      variably reduced while color vision is unaffected.
