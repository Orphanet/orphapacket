  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of hemochromatosis characterized by the combination of
      pathogenic variants in two genes involved in iron metabolism (usually a combination
      of HFE and non-HFE mutations) where the classical HFE-related hemochromatosis
      is not enough to fully explain the clinical picture of the patient.
