  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired skeletal muscle disease characterized by sudden onset
      of muscle weakness tenderness and pain during or following recovery from a viral
      illness. The most commonly reported underlying viral infections are influenza
      B and A the latter being the significantly less frequent cause. Most cases occur
      in children. Symptoms are often limited to the calf muscles but other muscle
      groups may be involved as well. The condition is typically self-limiting resolving
      within several days although rhabdomyolysis with renal failure and compartment
      syndrome have been reported.
