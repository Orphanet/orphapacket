  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of thanatophoric dysplasia characterized by prenatal onset of
      growth deficiency of the limbs of less than 5% bowed femurs (like a telephone
      receiver) shortened ribs and platyspondyly. Fetal MRI can identify temporal
      lobe abnormalities and a narrow foramen magnum. Postnatally distinctive facial
      features include macrocephaly large anterior fontanel frontal bossing midface
      hypoplasia proptosis and low nasal bridge. Neonates usually die shortly after
      birth due to respiratory insufficiency and/or spinal cord/brain stem compression.
