  TextSection:
    Contents: The MMEP syndrome is a congenital syndromic form of split-hand/foot
      malformation (SHFM; see this term). It is characterized by microcephaly microphthalmia
      ectrodactyly of the lower limbs and prognathism. Intellectual deficit has been
      reported. MMEP syndrome is considered to be a very rare condition although the
      exact prevalence remains unknown. The etiology is not completely understood.
      Disruption of the sorting nexin 3 gene (<i>SNX3</i>; 6q21) has been shown to
      play a causative role in MMEP although this was not confirmed in recent studies.
