  TextSection:
    Contents: A partial autosomal monosomy characterized clinically by lethal pulmonary
      disease that presents as severe respiratory distress and refractory pulmonary
      hypertension within a few hours after birth and typically results in death from
      respiratory failure within the first months of life. Characteristic histological
      features of lung tissue include paucity of alveolar wall capillaries alveolar
      wall thickening muscular hypertrophy of the pulmonary arteries and malposition
      of the small pulmonary veins. Various additional congenital malformations may
      be associated mostly gastrointestinal (intestinal malrotation and atresias anular
      pancreas) genitourinary (dilatation of urinary tracts duplicated uterus) and
      cardiovascular anomalies (hypoplastic left heart and other congenital heart
      defects).
