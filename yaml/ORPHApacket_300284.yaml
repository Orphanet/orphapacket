  TextSection:
    Contents: Connective tissue disorder due to lysyl hydroxylase-3 deficiency is
      a rare genetic disease caused by lack of lysyl hydrohylase 3 (LH3) activity
      characterized by multiple tissue and organ involvement including skeletal abnormalities
      (club foot progressive scoliosis osteopenia pathologic fractures) ocular involvement
      (flat retinae myopia cataracts) and hair nail and skin anomalies (coarse abnormally
      distributed hair skin blistering reduced palmar creases hypoplastic nails).
      Patients also present intrauterine growth retardation facial dysmorphism (flat
      facial profile low-set ears shallow orbits short and upturned nose downturned
      corners of mouth) and joint flexion contractures. Growth and developmental delay
      bilateral sensorineural deafness friable diaphragm and later-onset spontaneous
      vascular ruptures are additional reported features.
