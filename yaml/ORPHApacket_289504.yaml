  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined malonic and methylmalonic acidemia is a rare inborn error of
      metabolism characterized by elevation of malonic acid (MA) and methylmalonic
      acid (MMA) in body fluids with higher levels of MMA than MA. CMAMMA presents
      in childhood with metabolic acidosis developmental delay dystonia and failure
      to thrive or in adulthood with seizures memory loss and cognitive decline.
