  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multisystemic inherited metabolic diseases characterized clinically
      by a variable spectrum of severity primarily comprised of psychomotor delay
      myopathy and liver dysfunction. Most patients present in infancy but the onset
      can be already <i>in utero</i> or in adult age. Hypermethioninemia is frequent
      but often absent in infancy. Creatine kinase is elevated in most patients.
