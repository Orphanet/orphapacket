  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a slowly growing mass typically
      involving tendons and aponeuroses of the extremities composed of polygonal or
      spindle-shaped cells with melanocytic differentiation. The tumor typically affects
      young adults who often present with pain or tenderness at the tumor site. Prognosis
      is poor with high recurrence rates and frequent metastasis especially to lymph
      nodes lung and bones.
