  TextSection:
    Contents: Seizures-scoliosis-macrocephaly syndrome is a rare genetic neurometabolic
      disorder characterized by seizures macrocephaly delayed motor milestones moderate
      intellectual disability scoliosis with no exostoses muscular hypotonia present
      since birth as well as renal dysfunction. Coarse facial features (including
      hypertelorism and long hypoplastic philtrum) and bilateral cryptorchidism (in
      males) are also commonly reported. Additional manifestations include abnormal
      gastrointestinal motility (resulting in constipation diarrhea gastroesophageal
      reflux and dysphagia) gait disturbances strabismus and ventricular septal defects.
