  TextSection:
    Contents: SRD5A3-CDG is a rare non X-linked congenital disorder of glycosylation
      due to steroid 5 alpha reductase type 3 deficiency characterized by a highly
      variable phenotype typically presenting with severe visual impairment variable
      ocular anomalies (such as optic nerve hypoplasia/atrophy iris and optic nerve
      coloboma congenital cataract glaucoma) intellectual disability cerebellar abnormalities
      nystagmus hypotonia ataxia and/or ichthyosiform skin lesions. Other reported
      manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa kyphosis congenital heart defects
      hypertrichosis and abnormal coagulation.
