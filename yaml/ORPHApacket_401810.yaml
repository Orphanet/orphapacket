  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 64 is an extremely rare
      and complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia reported in only 4 patients
      from 2 families to date characterized by spastic paraplegia (presenting between
      the ages of 1 to 4 years with abnormal gait) associated with microcephaly amyotrophy
      cerebellar signs (e.g. dysarthria) aggressiveness delayed puberty and mild to
      moderate intellectual disability. SPG64 is due to mutations in the <i>ENTPD1</i>
      gene (10q24.1) encoding ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1.
