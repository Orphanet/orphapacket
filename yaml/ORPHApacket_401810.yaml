  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 64 is an extremely rare
      and complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (see this term) reported in
      only 4 patients from 2 families to date characterized by spastic paraplegia
      (presenting between the ages of 1 to 4 years with abnormal gait) associated
      with microcephaly amyotrophy cerebellar signs (e.g. dysarthria) aggressiveness
      delayed puberty and mild to moderate intellectual disability. SPG64 is due to
      mutations in the <i>ENTPD1</i> gene (10q24.1) encoding ectonucleoside triphosphate
      diphosphohydrolase 1.
