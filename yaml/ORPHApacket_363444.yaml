    Contents: THOC6-related developmental delay-microcephaly-facial dysmorphism syndrome
      is a rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized by
      global development delay microcephaly moderate to severe intellectual disability
      and facial dysmorphism which includes tall forehead high anterior hairline short
      upslanting palpebral fissures deep-set eyes and a long nose with a low-hanging
      columella. Additionally congenital renal and cardiac malformations (such as
      horseshoe kidney unilateral renal agenesis atrioventricular septal defects patent
      ductus arteriosus) as well as corpus callosum dysplasia may be associated.
