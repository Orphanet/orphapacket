    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by postnatal growth retardation
      generalized lipodystrophy skeletal (delayed closure of sutures clavicular hypoplasia
      dysplastic femoral head acroosteolysis of distal phalanges osteopenia/osteoporosis)
      and cardiac manifestations (including left ventricular hypertrophy mitral valve
      calcifications/prolapse/insufficiency and mitral regurgitation) skin changes
      (atrophic skin poikiloderma and hyperkeratosis) progeroid traits and dysmorphic
      facial features (including prominent eyes long pinched nose full cheeks microstomia
      and mandibular hypoplasia). Most of the patients also present with sparse body
      hair nail dystrophy joint contracture hypotonia hepatosplenomegaly and hypertension.
      Additional clinical features may include renal glomerulosclerosis and severe
      proteinuria recurrent pulmonary infections and seizures.
