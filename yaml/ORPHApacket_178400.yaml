  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by a progressive
      muscle weakness starting in the anterior tibial muscles later involving lower
      and upper limb muscles associated with an increased serum creatine kinase levels
      and absence of dysferlin on muscle biopsy. Patients become wheelchair dependent.
