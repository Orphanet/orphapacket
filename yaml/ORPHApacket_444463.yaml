  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic immune disease characterized by infantile or childhood
      onset of combined immunodeficiency with recurrent viral bacterial and fungal
      infections severe autoimmunity mainly manifesting as antibody-mediated destruction
      of red blood cells platelets and neutrophils and mild to moderate developmental
      delay. Laboratory findings include decreased circulating T- B- and natural killer
      cells and hypergammaglobulinemia.
