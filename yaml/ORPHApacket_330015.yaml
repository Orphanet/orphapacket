  TextSection:
    Contents: Lead poisoning is defined as acute or chronic exposure to lead resulting
      in lead accumulation (blood lead concentration (BLC) >5 ug/dL) that can affect
      every organ system in the body and to which children are more susceptible. Clinical
      manifestations depend on the amount and duration of exposure and include abdominal
      pain colic constipation lead line on gingival tissue arthralgia myalgia peripheral
      neuropathy fatigue irritability anemia chronic nephropathy and hypertension.
      In children even low levels of exposure (BLC <5 ug/dL) is reported to lead to
      irreversible effects such as loss of cognition shortening of attention span
      alteration of behavior dyslexia attention deficit disorder hypertension renal
      impairment immunotoxicity and toxicity to the reproductive organs.
