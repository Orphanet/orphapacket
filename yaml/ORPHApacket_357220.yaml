  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary essential cutis verticis gyrata is a rare progressive dermis
      disorder characterized by thickening of the scalp resulting in redundancy of
      the skin which gives rise to folds and grooves that give the scalp a cerebriform
      appearance. Folds cannot be corrected by pressure or traction and typically
      are symmetric and extend anteroposteriorly from vertex to occiput and/or transversely
      in occipital region. Additional features may include mild subungual hyperkeratosis
      and distal onycholysis of the nail plates of the great toes. It is not associated
      with neurological and ophthalmological changes nor with secondary causes.
