  TextSection:
    Contents: Semantic dementia (SD) is a form of frontotemporal dementia (FTD; see
      this term) characterized by the progressive amodal and profound loss of semantic
      knowledge (combination of visual associative agnosia anomia surface dyslexia
      or dysgraphia and disrupted comprehension of word meaning) and behavioral abnormalities
      attributable to the degeneration of the anterior temporal lobes.
