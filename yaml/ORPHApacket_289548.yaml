  TextSection:
    Contents: Inherited isolated adrenal insufficiency due to partial CYP11A1 deficiency
      is a rare genetic chronic primary adrenal insufficiency disorder due to partial
      loss-of-function CYP11A1 mutations characterized by early-onset adrenal insufficiency
      without associated abnormal external male genitalia. Patients present with signs
      of adrenal crisis including electrolite abnormalities severe weakness recurrent
      vomiting and seizures. Ultrasound reveals absent (or very small) adrenal glands.
