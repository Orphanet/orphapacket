  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary orthostatic disorder characterized by dizziness
      palpitations fatigue blurred vision and tachycardia following postural change
      from a supine to an upright position in the absence of hypotension. A syncope
      with transient cognitive impairment and dyspnea may also occur. The norepinephrine
      transporter deficiency leads to abnormal uptake and high plasma concentrations
      of norepinephrine.
