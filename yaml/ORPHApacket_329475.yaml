  TextSection:
    Contents: Spastic paraplegia-Paget disease of bone syndrome is an extremely rare
      complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by a slowly progressive
      spastic paraplegia (with increased muscle tone decreased strength in the anterior
      tibial muscles and hyperreflexia in the lower extremities with Babinski sign)
      presenting in adulthood associated with Paget disease of the bone. Cognitive
      decline dementia and myopathic changes at muscle biopsy have not been reported.
