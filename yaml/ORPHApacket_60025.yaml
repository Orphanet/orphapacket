  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic respiratory disease characterized by widespread intra-alveolar
      accumulation of minute calcium phosphate microliths leading to pulmonary fibrosis
      pulmonary hypertension and chronic respiratory failure. Age of onset is highly
      variable and most patients are asymptomatic for years or decades before signs
      and symptoms like dyspnea on exertion dry cough chest pain hemoptysis or finger
      clubbing develop. The disease takes a long-term progressive course. Routine
      chest radiographs typically show a fine ''sandstorm-like'' micronodular pattern
      that is more pronounced in the bases than in the apices.
