  TextSection:
    Contents: A pure form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by slowly
      progressive spastic paraplegia of lower extremities with an age of onset ranging
      from childhood to adulthood and patients presenting with spastic gait increased
      tendon reflexes in lower limbs extensor plantar response weakness and atrophy
      of lower limb muscles and in rare cases pes cavus. No abnormalities are noted
      on magnetic resonance imaging.
