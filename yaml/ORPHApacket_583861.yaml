  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare intestinal disease characterized by isolated thrombosis of the
      mesenteric veins without involvement of the splenic or portal veins potentially
      causing mesenteric ischemia. It may be primary/idiopathic or due to one or more
      local or systemic predisposing conditions and may be acute/subacute or chronic
      the latter being used for patients with symptoms lasting longer than 4 weeks
      but without bowel infarction or patients without recent symptoms where the thrombosis
      is an incidental finding. Symptoms depend on the extent and severity of thrombosis
      and often involve prolonged nonspecific abdominal complaints.
