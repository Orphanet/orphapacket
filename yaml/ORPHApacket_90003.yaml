  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare benign liver tumor characterized by a prominent inflammatory
      infiltrate and often mimicking a malignant liver neoplasm. The tumor is frequently
      solitary with a predilection for the right lobe; however multiple lesions are
      possible. There are two clinicopathological subtypes: fibrohistiocytic inflammatory
      pseudotumor of the liver and lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory pseudotumor of the
      liver. Patients present with non-specific clinical symptoms such as abdominal
      pain or discomfort fever and weight loss. The condition may be associated with
      other chronic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases.'
