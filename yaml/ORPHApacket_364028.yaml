    Contents: A rare genetic X-linked syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized
      by moderate to severe intellectual disability associated with epilepsy short
      stature autistic features and behavioral problems such as self injury and aggressive
      outbursts. Observed facial dysmorphism includes brachycephaly prominent supraorbital
      ridges and deep set eyes. Additional variable manifestations include malposition
      of feet asthenic habitus hyporeflexia bowel occlusions hydronephrosis ren arcuatus
      delayed motor development and disturbed sleep-wake cycle.
