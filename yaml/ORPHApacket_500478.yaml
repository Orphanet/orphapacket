  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a malignant epithelial neoplasm
      with evidence of squamous differentiation which may arise in association with
      high-risk HPV in a subset of cases. HPV-positive tumors have a strong predilection
      for the base of tongue and the palatine tonsils and typically present at an
      advanced clinical stage with cervical lymphadenopathy. They are associated with
      significantly better prognosis than HPV-negative tumors which more commonly
      involve the soft palate manifest as sore throat and difficulty in swallowing
      or a neck mass and occur in older patients. Smoking and alcohol consumption
      are important risk factors.
