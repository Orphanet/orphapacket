  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic cerebral malformation characterized by congenital
      partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum. Patients are often asymptomatic
      but may also present with intellectual disability visual impairment delayed
      speech development seizures feeding difficulties impaired hand-eye coordination
      and behavioral abnormalities. Patients may have a normal intelligence quotient
      while exhibiting specific cognitive deficits such as reduced interhemispheric
      transfer of sensorimotor information reduced cognitive processing speed and
      deficits in complex reasoning and novel problem-solving.
