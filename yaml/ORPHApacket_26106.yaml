  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer is a rare epithelial tumor of the
      stomach characterized by the development of diffuse (signet ring cell) gastric
      cancer at a young age associated with germline heterozygous mutations of <i>CDH1</i>
      <i>MAP3K6</i> and <i>CTNNA1</i> genes. In early stages it presents with non-specific
      and vague symptoms in advanced stages it may cause nausea and vomiting dysphagia
      loss of appetite abdominal mass or weight loss. Women have an increased risk
      of lobular breast cancer as well.
