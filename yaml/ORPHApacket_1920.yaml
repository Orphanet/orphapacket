  TextSection:
    Contents: A neurodevelopmental teratologic syndrome due to prenatal exposure to
      toluene. The disease is characterized by prematurity low birth weight dysmorphic
      features (short palpebral fissures deep set eyes low set ears mid-facial hypoplasia
      flat nasal bridge thin upper lip micrognathia spatulate fingertips and small
      fingernails) central nervous system dysfunctions (intellectual disability microcephaly
      language impairment hyperactivity visual dysfunction) and postnatal growth delay.
      Prenatal exposure to toluene occurs as a result of incidental occupational exposure
      or solvent abuse during pregnancy. The features of toluene embryopathy often
      overlap with those seen in fetal alcohol syndrome.
