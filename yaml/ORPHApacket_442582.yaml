    Contents: A rare systemic amyloidosis characterized by the aggregation and deposition
      of amyloid fibrils composed of monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy-chain fragments
      usually produced by a plasma cell neoplasm. Amyloid fibrils deposit in various
      organs most commonly in the kidneys. It typically affects older patients and
      clinical presentation includes signs and symptoms of renal dysfunction sometimes
      leading to nephrotic syndrome and end stage renal disease. Cardiac liver and
