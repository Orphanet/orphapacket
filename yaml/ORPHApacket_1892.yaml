  TextSection:
    Contents: Ectrodactyly-polydactyly syndrome is a rare genetic congenital limb
      malformation disorder characterized by hypoplasia or absence of central digital
      rays of the hands and/or feet and the presence of one or more unilateral or
      bilateral supernumerary digits on postaxial rays ranging from hypoplastic digits
      devoid of osseous structures to complete duplication of a digit. Cutaneous syndactyly
      symphalangism and clinodactyly have also been reported. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1982.
