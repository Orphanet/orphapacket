  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare tumor of salivary glands characterized by a benign well-circumscribed
      slow-growing painless mass most commonly occurring in the parotid gland (but
      also the palate submandibular gland or nasal septal mucosa) histopathologically
      composed of epithelial and myoepithelial / stromal components. Possible signs
      and symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and include facial nerve weakness
      mild dysphagia or unilateral nasal obstruction. Recurrence rates are low although
      tumor rupture and spillage have been reported. Malignant transformation may
      occur in a small percentage of cases.
