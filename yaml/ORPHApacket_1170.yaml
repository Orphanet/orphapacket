  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by early
      onset of non- or slowly progressive cerebellar signs and symptoms including
      truncal and gait ataxia dysarthria dysmetria dysdiadochokinesis tremor and nystagmus.
      Delayed psychomotor development and intellectual disability are variable. Additional
      reported features are spasticity hypotonia cataracts and sensorineural hearing
      loss among others. Brain imaging shows cerebellar atrophy.
