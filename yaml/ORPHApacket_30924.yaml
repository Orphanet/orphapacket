    Contents: Primary hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (PHSH) is a form
      of familial primary hypomagnesemia (FPH see this term) characterized by severe
      hypomagnesemia and secondary hypocalcemia associated with neurological symptoms
      including generalized seizures tetany and muscle spasms. PHSH may be fatal or
