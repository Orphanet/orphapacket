  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia (PHSH) is a form
      of familial primary hypomagnesemia (FPH) characterized by severe hypomagnesemia
      and secondary hypocalcemia associated with neurological symptoms including generalized
      seizures tetany and muscle spasms. PHSH may be fatal or may result in chronic
      irreversible neurological complications.
