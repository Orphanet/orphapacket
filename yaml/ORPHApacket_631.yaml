  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-acquired pituitary hormone deficiency characterized by growth
      deficiency delayed bone age and short stature of variable severity and age of
      onset and with variable response to treatment with recombinant human growth
      hormone depending on the respective subtype of the disease. Hormone deficiency
      may be quantitative or qualitative in nature.
