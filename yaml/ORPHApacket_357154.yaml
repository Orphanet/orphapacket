    Contents: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic progressive disease that
      alters the fibroelasticity of the oral submucosa prevalent in India and Southeast
      Asia but rare elsewhere and characterized by burning and pain in the oral cavity
      loss of gustatory sensation the presence of blanched fibrous bands and stiffening
      of the oral mucosa and oro-pharynx (leading to trismus and a progressive reduction
      in mouth opening) and an increased risk of developing oral squamous cell cancer
      (3-19%). It is usually associated with the chewing of the areca nut (an ingredient
      in betel quid) but the exact etiology is unknown and there is currently no effective
      treatment.
