  TextSection:
    Contents: Talo-patello-scaphoid osteolysis is an extremely rare form of primary
      osteolysis (see this term) described in two sisters to date characterized by
      bilateral osteolysis of the tali scaphoids and patellae (accompanied by periarticular
      swelling and pain) and short fourth metacarpals (brachydactyly type E; see this
      term) in the absence of renal disease. Autosomal recessive inheritance has been
      suggested.
