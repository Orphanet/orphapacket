  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease a peripheral sensorimotor
      neuropathy characterized by symmetric weakness primarily occurring in the lower
      limbs (distal muscles in a majority of cases) and reaching the arms only after
      5 to 10 years occasional and predominantly distal sensory loss and reduced tendon
      reflexes. It presents with gait anomaly between the 1st and 6th decade and early
      onset is generally associated to a more severe phenotype which may include foot
      drop.
