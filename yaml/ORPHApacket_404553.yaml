  TextSection:
    Contents: Vasculitis due to ADA2 deficiency is a rare genetic systemic and rheumatologic
      disease due to adenosine deaminase-2 inactivating mutations combining variable
      features of autoinflammation vasculitis and a mild immunodeficiency. Variable
      clinical presentation includes chronic or recurrent systemic inflammation with
      fever livedo reticularis or racemosa early-onset ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes
      peripheral neuropathy abdominal pain hepatosplenomegaly portal hypertension
