  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial bicuspid aortic valve is a rare genetic aortic malformation
      defined as a presence of abnormal two-leaflet aortic valve in at least 2 first-degree
      relatives. It is frequently asymptomatic or may be associated with progressive
      aortic valve disease (aortic regurgitation and/or aortic stenosis typically
      due to valve calcification) and a concomitant aortopathy (i.e. aortic dilation
      aortic aneurysm and/or dissection).
