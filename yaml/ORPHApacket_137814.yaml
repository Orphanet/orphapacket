    Contents: Macular amyloidosis (MA) is a rare chronic form of cutaneous amyloidosis
      (see this term) a skin disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid
      deposits in the dermis clinically characterized by pruritic hyperkeratotic gray-brown
      macules that give a rippled or reticulated pattern of pigmentation usually in
      the upper back and extensor sites of arms forearms and legs and histologically
      by the deposition of amyloid in the upper dermis and close to the basal cell
      layer of the epidermis. MA is commonly associated with other skin diseases such
      as atopic dermatitis.
