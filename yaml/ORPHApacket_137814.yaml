    Contents: Macular amyloidosis (MA) is a rare chronic form of cutaneous amyloidosis
      a skin disease characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the
      dermis clinically characterized by pruritic hyperkeratotic gray-brown macules
      that give a rippled or reticulated pattern of pigmentation usually in the upper
      back and extensor sites of arms forearms and legs and histologically by the
      deposition of amyloid in the upper dermis and close to the basal cell layer
      of the epidermis. MA is commonly associated with other skin diseases such as
      atopic dermatitis.
