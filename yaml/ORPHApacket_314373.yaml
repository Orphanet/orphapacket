  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic intestinal disease characterized by early-onset chronic
      diarrhea and intestinal inflammation due to overactivity of guanylate cyclase
      2C. Additional manifestations include meteorism dehydration metabolic acidosis
      and electrolyte disturbances. Intestinal dysmotility small-bowel obstruction
      and esophagitis (with or without esophageal hernia) as well as irritable bowel
      syndrome (without severe abdominal pain) and Crohn's disease are frequently
      associated.
