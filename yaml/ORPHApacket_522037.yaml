  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare intestinal disease characterized by immune-mediated injury of
      the intestinal mucosa leading to severe chronic intractable diarrhea malabsorption
      and severe weight loss or failure to thrive. Characteristic histologic findings
      in the small intestine include partial or complete blunting of the villi deep
      crypt lymphocytosis increased crypt apoptosis and minimal surface intraepithelial
      lymphocytosis. In addition the stomach colon and esophagus may also be involved.
      Circulating autoantibodies against enterocytes and/or goblet cells are found
      in many but not all patients. The diagnosis requires exclusion of other causes
      of villous atrophy.
