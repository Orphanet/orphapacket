  TextSection:
    Contents: Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by <i>Coccidioides immitis</i>
      and <i>C. posadasii</i> which is endemic to the Southwestern United States Central
      America South America and Mexico and is acquired by inhalation of the infective
      arthroconidia often found in soil. In most cases it is a benign self-limiting
      febrile illness but in a minority of cases it can become a potentially lethal
      infection of the lungs and extremely rarely spread to other organs (through
      hematogenous dissemination) with manifestations including meningitis osteomyelitis
      and skin and soft-tissue involvement.
