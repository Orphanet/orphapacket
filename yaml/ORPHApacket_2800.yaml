  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin tumor characterized by predominantly intraepithelial growth
      of an adenocarcinoma which may either arise primarily in the skin (primary extramammary
      Paget disease) or result from intraepithelial spread of a visceral carcinoma
      (secondary extramammary Paget disease). The lesion is typically located in the
      anogenital region presenting as a scaly oozing pruritic or painful erythematous
      plaque often resembling eczema. It may exhibit an invasive component with a
      significant risk of lymph node metastasis.
