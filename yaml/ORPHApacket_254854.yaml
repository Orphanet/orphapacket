  TextSection:
    Contents: Pure mitochondrial myopathy is a rare mitochondrial disease characterized
      by exclusive skeletal muscle involvement without clinical evidence of other
      organ involvement manifesting with progressive limb weakness proximal limb muscle
      atrophy and eye muscle anomalies (e.g. ocular motility restriction ptosis).
      Patients may present with lactic acidosis diffuse myalgia and overall fatigability
      (particularly during/after physical activities) dysphagia and diminished deep
      tendon reflexes.
