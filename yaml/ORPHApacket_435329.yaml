  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic bone disease characterized by multifocal painless benign
      fibrocemento-osseous lesions of the jaws which expand progressively and can
      cause severe facial deformity. It usually manifests at an early age and is often
      associated with abnormalities of the long bones and pathologic fractures. Radiologically
      the lesions are of mixed radiopaque/radiolucent appearance. Incomplete surgical
      removal may lead to more rapid growth of the residual lesion.
