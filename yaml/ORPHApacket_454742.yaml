  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare human prion disease characterized by accumulation of abnormal
      prion protein markedly less protease-resistant than in other prion diseases
      depending on the genotype at codon 129 of the prion protein gene. No mutations
      are found in the coding sequence of the gene. Neuropathological analysis shows
      spongiform change and prion protein deposition with microplaques in the cerebellum.
      Patients present with slowly progressive cognitive and motor decline psychiatric
      symptoms ataxia myoclonus or tremor among others. The disease is fatal and transmissible
      to other individuals.
