  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to JAGN1 deficiency
      is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by early-onset
      recurrent severe bacterial infections granulopoiesis maturation arrest at the
      promyelocyte/myelocyte stage and markedly reduced absolute neutrophil counts
      resulting from recessively inherited mutations in the <i>JAGN1</i> gene. Mild
      facial dysmorphism (i.e. triangular face) short stature failure to thrive hypothyroidism
      developmental delay pancreatic insufficiency and coarctation of aorta as well
      as bone and urogenital abnormalities may also be associated.
