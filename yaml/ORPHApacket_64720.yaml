  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a malignant space-occupying
      lesion most commonly located in the retroperitoneum or the inferior vena cava
      but also other soft tissues and composed of cells showing distinct features
      of smooth muscle cells. The tumor presents with mass effect depending on the
      location. It is capable of both local recurrence and distant metastasis while
      lymph node metastasis is rare. Prognosis largely depends on tumor location and
      size.
