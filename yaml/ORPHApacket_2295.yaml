  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by generalized joint laxity leading
      to recurrent dislocation of major joints such as the hip (often with congenital
      hip dislocation) shoulder elbow or patella. Patients often experience muscle
      and joint pain (sometimes with effusion) and may develop degenerative joint
      changes at a relatively early age. Skin abnormalities are absent.
