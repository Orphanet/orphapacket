  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by hypomyelination
      of early myelinating structures such as the brainstem cerebellar white matter
      optic radiation and periventricular white matter while structures acquiring
      myelin later are better myelinated. Patients present in infancy with nystagmus
      developmental delay and progressive ataxic-spastic or ataxic syndrome. Cognitive
      functions are normal or only mildly impaired.
