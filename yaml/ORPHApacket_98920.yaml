  TextSection:
    Contents: Spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 is a rare genetic
      motor neuron disease characterized by severe respiratory distress/respiratory
      failure in association with diaphragmatic eventration and palsy as well as progressive
      symmetrical distal-to-proximal muscle weakness and atrophy (in lower limbs especially).
      Patients typically have a history of intrauterine growth retardation low birth
      weight feeble cry weak suck and failure to thrive and present with inspiratory
      stridor recurrent episodes of dyspnea or apnea cyanosis and absent deep tendon
      reflexes. Kyphosis/scoliosis foot deformities and joint contractures are frequently
      associated features.
