  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Central neurocytoma is a very rare brain tumor of young adults (over
      100 cases reported worldwide). It is typically found in the lateral ventricles
      and occasionally in the third ventricle. Symptoms are those of increased intracranial
      pressure: headache nausea and vomiting drowsiness vision problems and mental
      changes. Total removal of the tumor is the therapy of choice. Post-operative
      prognosis is generally good.'
