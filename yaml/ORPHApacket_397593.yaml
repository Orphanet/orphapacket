  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe neonatal lactic acidosis due to NFS1-ISD11 complex deficiency
      is a rare hereditary mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by severe neonatal lactic acidosis and deficiency of mitochondrial complexes
      I II and III. Clinical features are variable and may include hypotonia respiratory
      distress with cyanosis failure to thrive feeding difficulties hypoglycemia dehydration
      vomiting seizures and a risk of multiple organ failure.
