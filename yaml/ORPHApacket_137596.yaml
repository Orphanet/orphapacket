  TextSection:
    Contents: Neurotrophic keratopathy is a rare degenerative disease of the cornea
      characterized by reduction or loss of corneal sensitivity that can be asymptomatic
      or present with red-eye and during the early stages of the disease a minor decrease
      in visual acuity. It eventually leads to loss of vision.
