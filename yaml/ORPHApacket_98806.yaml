  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic movement disorder characterized by dystonia affecting
      at first an upper limb less frequently beginning in the head and neck region
      before slowly spreading to other locations. The clinical spectrum like age of
      onset is variable with focal segmental or generalized distribution but cranial
      involvement with speech difficulties and cervical involvement are typical whereas
      lower limbs are often spared. With progression of the disease many patients
      suffer from generalized dystonia while mostly remaining ambulatory.
