  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by moderate to severe intellectual disability developmental delay macrocephaly
      speech delay and hypotonia. Dysmorphic facial features include a high broad

      thin upper lip and a pointed chin. Additional variable manifestations include
      joint laxity abnormality of vision (including hypermetropia strabismus and cerebral
      visual impairment) genital abnormalities in males and inguinal umbilical or
      hiatal hernia.
