    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation in
      any organ system with onset prior to adulthood presenting highly variable clinical
      manifestations which usually have a more aggressive course and higher rate of
      major organ involvement than adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus resulting
      in potential damage to a variety of organs (e.g. the skin kidneys lungs nervous
      system).
