    Contents: Congenital muscular dystrophy type 1B is a rare genetic neuromuscular
      disorder characterized by proximal and symmetrical muscle weakness (particularly
      of neck sternomastoid facial and diaphragm muscles) spinal rigidity joint contractures
      (Achilles tendon elbows hands) generalized muscle hypertrophy and early respiratory
      failure (usually in the first decade of life). Patients typically present delayed
      motor milestones and grossly elevated serum creatine kinase levels and with
      disease progression forced expiratory abdominal squeeze and nocturnal hypoventilation.
