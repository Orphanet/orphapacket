  TextSection:
    Contents: Sanjad-Sakati syndrome (SSS) also known as hypoparathyroidism - intellectual
      disability-dysmorphism is a rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome mainly
      occurring in the Middle East and the Arabian Gulf countries characterized by
      intrauterine growth restriction at birth microcephaly congenital hypoparathyroidism
      (that can cause hypocalcemic tetany or seizures in infancy) severe growth retardation
      typical facial features (long narrow face deep-set eyes beaked nose floppy and
      large ears long philtrum thin lips and micrognathia) and mild to moderate intellectual
      deficiency. Ocular findings (i.e. nanophthalmos retinal vascular tortuosity
      and corneal opacification/clouding) and superior mesenteric artery syndrome
      have also been reported. Although SSS shares the same locus with the autosomal
      recessive form of Kenny-Caffey syndrome (see this term) the latter differs from
      SSS by its normal intelligence and skeletal features.
