  TextSection:
    Contents: Tarsal kink syndrome is a rare congenital malformation of the tarsus
      that causes entropion characterized by blepharospasm and absence of an upper
      eyelid fold that may lead to corneal ulceration caused by the folded edge of
      the upper tarsus or the inturned eyelashes if not corrected by surgery.
