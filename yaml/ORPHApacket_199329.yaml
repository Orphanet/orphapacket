  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by early onset of
      hypotonia delayed motor development and variably progressive generalized muscle
      weakness. Predominant involvement of pelvic and neck flexor muscles has been
      reported as well as early involvement of hamstrings and medial gastrocnemius
      visible on muscle MRI. Serum creatine kinase levels are markedly elevated (in
      some cases already from early childhood). Muscle biopsy shows absence of dysferlin.
