  TextSection:
    Contents: Greenberg dysplasia is a very rare lethal skeletal dysplasia characterized
      by fetal hydrops short limbs and abnormal chondro-osseous calcification. The
      disease is characterized by early <i>in utero</i> lethality and affected fetuses
      are considered as nonviable.
