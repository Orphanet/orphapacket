  TextSection:
    Contents: Larsen-like osseous dysplasia-short stature syndrome is a rare primary
      bone dysplasia characterized by a Larsen-like phenotype including multiple congenital
      large joint dislocations craniofacial abnormalities (i.e. macrocephaly flat
      occiput prominent forehead hypertelorism low-set malformed ears flat nose cleft
      palate) spinal abnormalities cylindrical fingers and talipes equinovarus as
      well as growth retardation (resulting in short stature) and delayed bone age.
      Other reported clinical manifestations include severe developmental delay hypotonia
      clinodactyly congenital heart defect and renal dysplasia.
