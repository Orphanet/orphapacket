  TextSection:
    Contents: Loose anagen syndrome is a rare benign hair disorder affecting predominantly
      blond females in childhood and characterized by the presence of hair that can
      be easily and painlessly pulled out. Most of the hair is in the anagen phase
      and lacks an external epithelial sheath. Hair grows back quickly and the condition
      improves spontaneously with aging. Loose anagen hair can be associated with
      other anomalies such as coloboma.
