    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by lethargy hypotonia poor feeding
      opisthotonus and a typical high-pitched cry due to bilirubin accumulation in
      the globus pallidus sub-thalamic nuclei and other brain regions resulting from
      severe neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Onset of symptoms is typically
      within the first three to five days of life. Additional features include fever
      apnea seizures and coma. Especially respiratory failure or refractory seizures
      may lead to a fatal outcome.
