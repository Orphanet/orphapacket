  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an
      X-linked recessive inheritance pattern and the infantile-to childhood-onset
      of progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy (more prominent in the lower
      extremities than in the upper extremities) pes cavus and absent tendon reflexes.
      Sensory impairment and intellectual disability has been reported in some individuals.
