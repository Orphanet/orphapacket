  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 is a rare genetic peripheral
      sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern
      and the infantile- to childhood-onset of progressive distal muscle weakness
      and atrophy (more prominent in the lower extremities than in the upper extremities)
      pes cavus and absent tendon reflexes. Sensory impairment and intellectual disability
      has been reported in some individuals.
