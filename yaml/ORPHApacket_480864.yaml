  TextSection:
    Contents: Recurrent metabolic encephalomyopathic crises-rhabdomyolysis-cardiac
      arrhythmia-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare genetic neurodegenerative
      disease characterized by episodic metabolic encephalomyopathic crises (of variable
      frequency and severity which are frequently precipitated by an acute illness)
      which manifest with profound muscle weakness ataxia seizures cardiac arrhythmias
      rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria elevated plasma creatine kinase hypoglycemia
      lactic acidosis increased acylcarnitines and a disorientated or comatose state.
      Global developmental delay intellectual disability and cortical pyramidal and
      cerebellar signs develop with subsequent progressive neurodegeneration causing
      loss of expressive language and varying degrees of cerebral atrophy.
