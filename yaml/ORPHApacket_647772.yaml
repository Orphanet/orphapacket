  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare adrenocortical nodular disease characterized by increased to
      normal sized adrenal glands containing multiple small (less than 1&nbsp;cm in
      diameter) cortical pigmented (lipofuscin) nodules surrounded by internodular
      adrenocortical atrophy. It is typically associated with the development of a
      form of adrenal Cushing syndrome (CS). Rarely it has been associated with adrenal
      macronodules.
