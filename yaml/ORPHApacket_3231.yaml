  TextSection:
    Contents: Deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome is a group of rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis disorders characterized by the association of sensorineural
      deafness and onychodystrophy (e.g. absent/hypoplastic finger and toenails) as
      well as brachydactyly and finger-like thumbs. Additional features present in
      one of the diseases comprising this group include osteodystrophy intellectual
      disability seizures developmental delay and distinctive facies.
