  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare hereditary ataxia characterized by recurrent episodes
      of ataxia and vertigo which may be progressive. Weakness dystonia and ataxia
      are sometimes present in the interictal period. Seven types of episodic ataxia
      have been described to date (type 1 to type 7) but most of the reported cases
      are belong to type 1 and 2.
