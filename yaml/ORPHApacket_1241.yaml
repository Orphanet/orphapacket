  TextSection:
    Contents: Bencze syndrome or hemifacial hyperplasia with strabismus is a malformation
      syndrome involving the abnormal growth of the facial skeleton as well as its
      soft tissue structure and organs and is characterized by mild facial asymmetry
      with unaffected neurocranium and eyeballs as well as by esotropia amblyopia
      and/or convergent strabismus and occasionally submucous cleft palate. Transmission
      is autosomal dominant. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1979.
