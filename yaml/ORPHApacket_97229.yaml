  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic motor neuron disease characterized by a peripheral and
      cranial neuropathy neuronal loss in anterior horns and atrophy of spinal sensory
      tracts causing muscle weakness sensory loss diaphragmatic paralysis and respiratory
      insufficiency and multiple cranial nerve deficits such as sensorineural hearing
      loss bulbar symptoms and loss of vision due to optic atrophy. Depending on the
      transporter affected Riboflavin transporter deficiency 2 (RFVT2) and Riboflavin
      transporter deficiency 3 (RFVT3) are distinguished.
