      from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 22 with variable
      phenotype principally characterized by varying degrees of intellectual disabilty
      and developmental delay pre- and postnatal growth deficiency hypotonia and craniofacial
      dysmorphism (incl. microcephaly hypertelorism narrow and upslanted palpebral
