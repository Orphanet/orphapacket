  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a slow-growing usually painless
      subcutaneous nodule predominantly located in the extremities less frequently
      the trunk or head and neck region. Histopathologically the lesion is well-circumscribed
      lobulated and composed of epitheloid ovoid or spindle cells arranged in a nodular
      and often syncytial pattern with pseudoangiomatoid spaces and a peripheral fibrous
      pseudocapsule with a prominent lymphoplasmacytic cuff. The tumor is most common
      in the first two decades of life and usually follows an indolent course although
      local recurrence may occur while metastasis is rare.
