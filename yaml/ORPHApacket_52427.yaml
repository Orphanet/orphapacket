    Contents: A progressive form of familial flecked retinopathy characterized by
      white punctata throughout the fundus (but sparing the macula in the early stages).
      Patients present with nightblindness in childhood and may also experience a
      loss of visual acuity. Significant loss of vision is reported in the 5th and
      6th decades of life.
