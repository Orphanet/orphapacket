  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parathyroid disease and phosphocalcic metabolism anomaly characterized
      by hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia hypercalciuria and low serum parathyroid hormone
      levels in the presence of autoantibodies against parathyroid tissue. Clinical
      signs and symptoms are of variable severity and include paresthesia seizures
      laryngospasm tetany cardiac dysrhythmias calcifications of the basal ganglia
      and neuropsychological manifestations such as anxiety depression confusion or
      hallucination. The condition may occur as an isolated disease or in association
      with other autoimmune diseases.
