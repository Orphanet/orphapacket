  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by predisposition
      to recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections associated with decreased
      peripheral neutrophil granulocytes (absolute neutrophil count less than 500
      cells/microliter) resulting from recessively inherited loss-of-function mutations
      in the <i>CSF3R</i> gene. Full maturation of all three lineages in the bone
      marrow and refractoriness to in vivo rhG-CSF treatment are associated.
