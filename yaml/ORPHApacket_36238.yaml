  TextSection:
    Contents: Staphylococcal necrotizing pneumonia is a rare bacterial pulmonary infectious
      disease caused by a Panton-Valentine leukocidin-producing Staphylococcus aureus
      strain characterized by severe respiratory failure extensive rapidly progressing
      pneumonia and hemorrhagic lung necrosis. Patients typically present with influenza-like
      symptoms such as fever cough and chest pain as well as hemoptysis hypotension
      leukopenia and severe respiratory symptoms that rapidly evolve to acute respiratory
      distress syndrome and septic shock. High mortality is associated.
