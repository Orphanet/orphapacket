  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by
      a proliferation primarily of granulocytic and monocytic lineages with infiltration
      of the liver and spleen among other organs. Blasts and promonocytes account
      for less than 20% of white blood cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow.
      Erythroid and megakaryocytic abnormalities are often present. BCR-ABL1 fusion
      is absent while somatic mutations in genes of the RAS pathway or monosomy 7
      may be found. The condition may also occur in the context of neurofibromatosis
      type 1 or Noonan syndrome-like disorder. Children of less than three years are
      predominantly affected with a clear male preponderance. Most patients present
      with constitutional symptoms signs of infection and hepatosplenomegaly.
