  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-amyloid monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease characterized
      by production of monoclonal immunoglobulins with truncated heavy chains and
      no detectable light chains which are deposited in tissues and cause organ dysfunction
      but do not form amyloid beta-pleated sheets or contain an amyloid P component.
      The condition frequently occurs in association with multiple myeloma. Patients
      most commonly present with renal involvement (manifesting as hypertension progressive
      renal dysfunction anemia and nephrotic syndrome with microhematuria) but other
      organs (such as the liver or skin) may also be affected. Production of IgG1
      or IgG3 isotypes results in hypercomplementemia.
