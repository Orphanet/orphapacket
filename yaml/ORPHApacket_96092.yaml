  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chromosomal anomaly clinically characterized by mild to severe
      intellectual disability severe developmental delay (psychomotor and speech development)
      hypotonia with tendency to later develop progressive hypertonia and characteristic
      facial features. The main congenital anomalies associated include central nervous
      system (CNS) malformations such as hypoplasia/agenesis of the corpus callosum
      (80%) skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis/kyphosis or dislocated hips (60%)
      and congenital heart defects (25%).
