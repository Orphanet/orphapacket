  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal spastic paraplegia type 18 (SPG18) is a rare complex type
      of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by progressive spastic paraplegia
      (presenting in early childhood) associated with delayed motor development severe
      intellectual disability and joint contractures. A thin corpus callosum is equally
      noted on brain magnetic resonance imaging. SPG18 is caused by a mutation in
      the <i>ERLIN2</i> gene (8p11.2) encoding the protein Erlin-2.
