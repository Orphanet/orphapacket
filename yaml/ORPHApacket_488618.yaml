  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of pentose phosphate metabolism characterized by developmental
      delay and intellectual disability delayed or absent speech short stature and
      congenital heart defects (such as ventricular septal defect atrial septal defect
      and patent foramen ovale). Additional reported features include hypotonia hyperactivity
      stereotypic behavior ophthalmologic abnormalities (bilateral cataract uveitis
      strabismus) hearing impairment and variable facial dysmorphism among others.
      Laboratory analysis shows elevated plasma and urinary polyols (erythritol arabitol
      and ribitol) and urinary sugar-phosphates (ribose-5-phosphate and xylulose/ribulose-5-phosphate).
