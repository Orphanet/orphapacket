  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare Y chromosome number anomaly with a variable phenotype mainly
      characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disability speech delay hypotonia
      and mild dysmorphic features including facial asymmetry hypertelorism bilateral
      low set 'lop' ears and micrognatia. Skeletal abnormalities (such as skull deformities
      radioulnar synostosis elbow flexion clinodactyly brachydactyly) and behavourial
      problems have also been associated with this condition. Genitalia are normal
      at birth although hypogonadism and azoospermia has been reported in adults.
