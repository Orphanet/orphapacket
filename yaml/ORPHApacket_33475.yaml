  TextSection:
    Contents: Meningococcal meningitis is an acute bacterial disease caused by <i>Neisseria
      meningitides</i> that presents usually but not always with a rash (non blanching
      petechial or purpuric rash) progressively developing signs of meningitis (fever
      vomiting headache photophobia and neck stiffness) and later leading to confusion
      delirium and drowsiness. Neck stiffness and photophobia are often absent in
      infants and young children who may manifest nonspecific signs such as irritability
      inconsolable crying poor feeding and a bulging fontanel. Meningococcal meningitis
      may also present as part of early or late onset sepsis in neonates. The disease
      is potentially fatal. Surviving patients may develop neurological sequelae that
      include sensorineural hearing loss seizures spasticity attention deficits and
      intellectual disability.
