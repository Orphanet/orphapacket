  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign proliferative disorder of the synovial membrane primarily
      affecting young adults (with a peak age of onset in the second to fourth decade
      of life) characterized by proliferative locally invasive tumor-like lesions
      usually involving a single joint tendon sheath or bursa (most commonly the joints
      of the knee and hip and rarely others such as the ankle shoulder and temporomandibular
      joints). It presents with pain and limitation of motion along with swelling
      heat and tenderness over the involved joint eventually leading to arthritic
      degeneration and significant locomotor deficit if left untreated. PVNS can recur
      in patients even after treatment.
