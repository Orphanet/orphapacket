  TextSection:
    Contents: Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare benign proliferative
      disorder of the synovial membrane primarily affecting young adults (with a peak
      age of onset in the second to fourth decade of life) characterized by proliferative
      locally invasive tumor-like lesions usually involving a single joint tendon
      sheath or bursa (most commonly the joints of the knee and hip and rarely others
      such as the ankle shoulder and temporomandibular joints). It presents with pain
      and limitation of motion along with swelling heat and tenderness over the involved
      joint eventually leading to arthritic degeneration and significant locomotor
      deficit if left untreated. PVNS can recur in patients even after treatment.
