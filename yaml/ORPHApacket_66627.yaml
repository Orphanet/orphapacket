  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by lesions predominantly originating
      from the synovial tissue of joints tendon sheaths or bursa. They are typically
      benign tumors that can either be localized or diffused. Localized tumors are
      usually painless firm and slow growing detected mostly in the fingers and hand
      (can also be present in wrist foot or ankle) and patients are asymptomatic.
      Diffuse-type tumors are more aggressive and often involve large joints (knee
      hip ankle and shoulder). Symptoms may include joint pain tenderness swelling
      limitation of motion and hemorrhagic joint effusions. Some localized tumors
      may recur however they are usually non-destructive. Recurrences are more common
      in diffused tumors and can lead to joint instability degenerative joint disease
      and significant functional impairment. Rare cases with malignant transformation
      presenting as aggressive sarcomas leading to local destruction and metastasis
      to lymph nodes (particularly inguinal and pelvic) and lungs are also reported.
