  TextSection:
    Contents: "Mal de d\xE9barquement (MdD) is a rare otorhinolaryngological disease\
      \ characterized by a persistent sensation of motion such as rocking swaying\
      \ tumbling and/or bobbing following a period of exposure to passive movement\
      \ usually an ocean cruise or other types of water train automobile or air travel\
      \ and less commonly other movements (like sleeping on a waterbed). Onset may\
      \ be spontaneous in some patients. Manifestations begin shortly after the stimulus\
      \ persist for 6 months to years and may be associated with anxiety fatigue and\
      \ impaired cognition. Symptoms are often accentuated when in an enclosed space\
      \ or when attempting to be motionless (sitting lying down or standing in a stationary\
      \ position) and are relieved when in passive motion such as in a moving car\
      \ airplane or train."
