  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by a phenotypic spectrum
      comprising severe intellectual disability developmental delay and in the majority
      of cases early-onset epilepsy. The most frequent seizure type are epileptic
      spasms but a broad spectrum of seizure types has been reported. Motor disturbances
      include ataxia hypotonia dystonia tremor spasticity and dyskinesia. Some patients
      may also present with autism/autistic-like features. Older patients have been
      reported to show signs of parkinsonism including tremor bradykinesia and antecollis.
