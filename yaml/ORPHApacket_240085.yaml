  TextSection:
    Contents: An atypical variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) a rare late-onset
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by prominent early parkinsonism (tremor
      limb bradykinesia axial and limb rigidity) rather than falls and cognitive change.
      Over the years patients ultimately develop clinical features characteristic
      of classical PSP. Neuropathological characteristics includes tau pathology and
      neuronal loss in specific brain areas especially in the subthalamic nucleus
      and substantia nigra. The tau pathology is less severe than in classical PSP.
