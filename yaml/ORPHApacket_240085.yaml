  TextSection:
    Contents: An atypical variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) a rare late-onset
      neurodegenerative disease by prominent early parkinsonism (tremor limb bradykinesia
      axial and limb rigidity) rather than falls and cognitive change. Over the years
      patients ultimately develop clinical features characteristic of classical PSP.
      Neuropathological characteristics includes tau pathology and neuronal loss in
      specific brain areas especially in the subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra.
      The tau pathology is less severe than in classical PSP.
