  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare variety of migraine with aura characterized by the presence
      of a motor weakness during the aura. There are two main forms depending on the
      familial history: patients with at least one first- or second-degree relative
      who has aura including motor weakness have familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM);
      patients without such familial history have sporadic hemiplegic migraine (SHM).'
