  TextSection:
    Contents: Uveal melanoma is a rare tumor of the eye arising from the choroid in
      90% of cases and from the iris and ciliary body in the other 10% of cases which
      clinically presents with visual symptoms (including blurred vision photopsia
      floaters and visual field reduction) a visible mass and pain. Fatal metastatic
      disease is seen in about half of all patients with the liver being the most
      frequent site of metastasis.
