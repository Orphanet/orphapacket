    Contents: A rare genetic premature aging disease characterized by sensorineural
      deafness generalized lack of subcutaneous fatty tissue (although with increased
      truncal deposition) noted from childhood scleroderma and facial dysmorphism
      which includes prominent eyes a beaked nose small mouth crowded teeth and mandibular
      hypoplasia. Other associated features include growth delay joint contractures
      telangiectasia hypogonadism (with lack of breast development in females) cryptorchidism
      skeletal muscle atrophy hypertriglyceridemia and diabetes mellitus/insulin resistance.
