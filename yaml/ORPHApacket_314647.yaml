  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia type 1 (ADCA
      type 1) characterized by the onset in infancy of cerebellar ataxia neonatal
      hypotonia (in some) mild developmental delay and in later life intellectual
      disability. Less common features include dysarthria dysmetria and dysmorphic
      facial features (long face bulbous nose long philtrum thick lower lip and pointed
      chin).
