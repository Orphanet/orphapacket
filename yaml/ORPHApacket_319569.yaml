  TextSection:
    Contents: "A genetic variant of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases\
      \ (MSMD) characterized by a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR1 leading to a residual\
      \ response to IFN-gamma and consequently to recurrent moderately severe infections\
      \ with bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria\
      \ (EM)."
