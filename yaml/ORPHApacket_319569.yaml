  TextSection:
    Contents: A genetic variant of mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases
      (MSMD) characterized by a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR1 leading to a residual
      response to IFN-gamma and consequently to recurrent moderately severe infections
      with bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria (EM).
