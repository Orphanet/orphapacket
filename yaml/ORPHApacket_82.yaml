  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary thrombophilia due to congenital antithrombin deficiency is
      a rare genetic hematological disease characterized by decreased levels of antithrombin
      activity in plasma resulting in impaired inactivation of thrombin and factor
      Xa. Patients have an increased risk for venous thromboembolism usually in the
      deep veins of the arms legs and pulmonary system and on occasion in other venous
      territories (e.g. cerebral veins or sinus mesenteric portal hepatic renal and/or
      retinal veins).
