  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease for which two subtypes exist either related
      to the gene <i>PLOD1</i> or <i>FKBP22</i> and for which the clinically overlapping
      characteristics include congenital muscle hypotonia congenital or early-onset
      kyphoscoliosis (progressive or non-progressive) and generalized joint hypermobility
      with dislocations/subluxations (in particular of the shoulders hips and knees).
      Additional features which may occur in both subtypes are skin hyperextensibility
      easy bruising of the skin rupture/aneurysm of a medium-sized artery osteopenia/osteoporosis
      blue sclerae umbilical or inguinal hernia chest deformity marfanoid habitus
      talipes equinovarus and refractive errors. Gene-specific features with variable
      presentation are additionally observed in each subtype.
