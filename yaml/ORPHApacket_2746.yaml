  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by pre-or postnatal severe rhizomelic
      micromelia with short long bones (congenital dwarfism) extremely short feet
      and hands major delay in skeletal ossification metaphyseal cupping severe platyspondyly
      muscular hypotonia and facial dysmorphism (including macrocephaly large anterior
      fontanelle arched and prominent eyebrows hypertelorism exophthalmos depressed
      nasal bridge small anteverted nose with relatively broad nares long philtrum
      and thin upper lip). Patients also present with short neck narrow bell-shaped
      thorax. Circumferential skin creases (especially in the upper arms hands and
      feet) and recurrent respiratory tract infections (that followed a fatal course
      in some cases) have also been reported.
