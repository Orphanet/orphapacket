  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by co-occurrence of sick sinus
      syndrome (manifesting as sinus bradycardia often requiring pacemaker implantation)
      and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (which may be of myogenic or neurogenic
      origin and usually requires total parenteral nutrition) with an age of onset
      within the first four decades of life. Other cardiac features such as atrial
      flutter or fibrillation and valve anomalies may also be present.
