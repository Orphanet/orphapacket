  TextSection:
    Contents: Supernumerary nostril is an extremely rare congenital malformation characterized
      by the presence of one or more accessory nostrils with or without accessory
      cartilage located medially above below or laterally to the other nostrils. Unlike
      in polyrhinia (see this term) there is no duplication of the nasal septum/cavity.
      Supernumerary nostril is often associated with other congenital malformations
      usually of face.
