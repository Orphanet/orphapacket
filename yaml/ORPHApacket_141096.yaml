  TextSection:
    Contents: Supernumerary nostril is an extremely rare congenital malformation characterized
      by the presence of one or more accessory nostrils with or without accessory
      cartilage located medially above below or laterally to the other nostrils. Unlike
      in polyrhinia there is no duplication of the nasal septum/cavity. Supernumerary
      nostril is often associated with other congenital malformations usually of face.
