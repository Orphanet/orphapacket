  TextSection:
    Contents: Fetal carbamazepine syndrome is a drug-related embryofetopathy that
      can occur when an embryo/fetus is exposed to carbamazepine and that is characterized
      by facial dysmorphism with some similarities to that seen in fetal valproate
      syndrome such as epicanthal folds upward slanting palpebral fissures short nose
      micrognathia and malar hypoplasia as well as nail dysplasia and major anomalies
      including cleft lip/palate neural tube defects and cardiac anomalies. <i>In
      utero</i> exposure to carbamazepine in combination with valproate has been associated
      with significant developmental delay (particularly affecting verbal intelligence)
      and a high rate of congenital anomalies.
