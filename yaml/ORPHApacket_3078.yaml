    Contents: A rare genetic X-linked syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized
      by severe intellectual disability microcephaly post-natal growth retardation
      severe visual impairment or blindness (due to optic atrophy) severe hearing
      defect spasticity epileptic seizures restricted large-joint movements and early
      death (in infancy or early childhood). Facial dysmorphic features (large dysplastic
      ears and short broad nose) are additionally observed. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1993.
