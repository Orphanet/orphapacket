    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 10 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by growth delay craniofacial dysmorphism
      (incl. prominent forehead hypertelorism upslanting palpebral fissures blepharophimosis
      low-set malformed large ears high arched palate cleft lip/palate retrognathia)
      and cardiac renal and skeletal (e.g. radial ray defects scoliosis) malformations
      with death usually ocurring neonatally or in early infancy. Other reported features
