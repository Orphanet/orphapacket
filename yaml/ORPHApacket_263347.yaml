  TextSection:
    Contents: MRCS syndrome is a rare genetic retinal dystrophy disorder characterized
      by bilateral microcornea rod-cone dystrophy cataracts and posterior staphyloma
      in the absence of other systemic features. Night blindness is typically the
      presenting manifestation and nystagmus strabismus astigmatism and angle closure
      glaucoma may be associated findings. Progressive visual acuity deterioration
      due to pulverulent-like cataracts results in poor vision ranging from no light
      perception to 20/400.
