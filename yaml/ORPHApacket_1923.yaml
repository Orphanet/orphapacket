  TextSection:
    Contents: A teratogenic embryofetopathy that results from maternal exposition
      to methimazole (MMI; or the parent compound carbimazole) in the first trimester
      of pregnancy. MMI is an antithyroid thionamide drug used for the treatment of
      Graves' disease. In the infant MMI may result in choanal atresia esophageal
      atresia omphalocele omphalomesenteric duct anomalies congenital heart disease
      (such as ventricular septal defect) renal system malformations and aplasia cutis.
      Additional features that may be observed include facial dysmorphism (short upslanting
      palpebral fissures a broad nasal bridge with a small nose and a broad forehead)
      and athelia/hypothelia.
