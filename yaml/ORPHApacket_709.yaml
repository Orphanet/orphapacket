  TextSection:
    Contents: Peters plus syndrome is an autosomal recessively inherited syndromic
      developmental defect of the eye (see this term) characterized by a variable
      phenotype including Peters anomaly (see this term) and other anterior chamber
      eye anomalies short limbs limb abnormalities (i.e. rhizomelia and brachydactyly)
      characteristic facial features (upper lip with cupid bow short palpebral fissures)
      cleft lip/palate and mild to severe developmental delay/intellectual disability.
      Other associated abnormalities reported in some patients include congenital
      heart defects (i.e. hypoplastic left heart absence of right pulmonary vein bicuspid
      pulmonary valve) genitourinary anomalies (hydronephrosis renal hypoplasia renal
      and ureteral duplication multicystic dysplastic kidneys glomerulocystic kidneys)
