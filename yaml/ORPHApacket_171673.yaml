  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare corneal disorder characterized by dysfunction and/or insufficient
      quantity of corneal limbal stem cells leading to impaired self-renewal of the
      corneal epithelium and resulting in epithelial breakdown corneal conjunctivalization
      and neovascularization chronic inflammation persistent epithelial defects and
      scarring. Patients usually present with ocular redness decreased vision photophobia
      foreign body sensation tearing and pain. The condition may be genetic idiopathic
      or acquired (in the context of inflammation infection trauma or ocular surface
      tumors).
