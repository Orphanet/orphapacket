  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by pre-and postnatal growth delay
      feeding difficulties muscular hypotonia motor developmental delay (with or without
      mild intellectual disability) and mild facial dysmorphism such as broad prominent
      forehead short nose with flat nasal root and wide tip downturned corners of
      mouth high-arched palate and micrognathia. Additonal features include childhood-onset
      central obesity premature puberty and variable bone abnormalities (e.g. small
      hands and feet dolichospondyly slender long bones and craniofacial disproportion).
