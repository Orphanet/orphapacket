  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic motor neuron disease characterized by decreased or absent
      fetal movements congenital proximal and distal joint contractures (consistent
      with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita) and multiple congenital fractures of
      the long bones. Further manifestations are neonatal respiratory distress severe
      muscular hypotonia areflexia dysphagia congenital heart defects and dysmorphic
      facial features. Muscle biopsy shows increased fiber-size variation and grouping
      of larger type I fibers. The disease is usually fatal in infancy due to respiratory
      failure.
