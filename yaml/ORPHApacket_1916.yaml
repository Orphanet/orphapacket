  TextSection:
    Contents: A malformation syndrome reported in offspring (children and grandchildren)
      of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy and is characterized
      by reproductive tract malformations decreased fertility and increased risk of
      developing clear cell carcinoma of the vagina and cervix in young women. Reproductive
      malformations reported in DES syndrome include small T-shaped uteri and other
      uterotubal anomalies that increase the risk of miscarriages in women and epididymal
      cysts microphallus cryptorchidism or testicular hypoplasia in men. DES a synthetic
      nonsteroidal estrogen was widely prescribed from 1940-1970 to prevent miscarriage.
