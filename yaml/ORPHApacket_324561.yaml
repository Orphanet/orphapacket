    Contents: A rare genetic epidermal disease characterized by punctate keratoderma
      on palms and soles associated with irregularly shaped hypopigmented macules
      (typically localized on the extremities). Ectopic calcification (e.g. early-onset
      calcific tendinopathy calcinosis cutis) and pachyonychia may be occasionally
      associated.
