  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial vesicoureteral reflux is a rare non-syndromic urogenital tract
      malformation characterized by the familial occurrence of retrograde flow of
      urine from the bladder into the ureter and sometimes the kidneys. Patients may
      be asymptomatic or may present with recurrent sometimes febrile urinary tract
      infections that in case of acute pyelonephritis may lead to serious complications
      (renal scarring hypertension renal failure). Spontaneous resolution of the disorder
      is possible.
