  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by disordered endochondral
      ossification of the medial part of the proximal tibial physis leading to multiplanar
      deformities of the lower limb. Patients present with bow-legged deformity with
      bone angulation just below the knee which is mostly bilateral. Severe deformity
      may result in early degenerative arthritis of the knee. It may occur as an isolated
      condition or as a part of a syndrome. It mostly occurs in infancy however adolescence-onset
      patients have also been reported. Risk factors may include obesity and early
      walking.
