  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic intellectual disability syndrome characterized by global
      developmental delay intellectual disability severe speech delay behavioral abnormalities
      (including impulsivity compulsivity stubbornness manipulative behaviors temper
      tantrums and aggressive behaviors) autism spectrum disorder and mild and variable
      dysmorphic facies (including deep-set eyes and a prominent nasal septum extending
      below the alae nasi) due to point mutation of <i>USP7</i> gene or 16p13.2 microdeletion
      where USP7 is completely or partially deleted. Behavioral abnormalities are
      more pronounced in microdeletion. Patients may also have hypotonia feeding problems
      delayed walking with unsteady gait hypogonadism in males seizures and ocular
      anomalies (such as myopia esotropia strabismus and nystagmus).
