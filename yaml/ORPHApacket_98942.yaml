  TextSection:
    Contents: Coloboma of choroid and retina is a rare genetic developmental defect
      during embryogenesis characterized by the partial absence of retinal pigment
      epithelium and choroid most frequently located in the inferonasal quadrant.
      Patients usually present reduced vision and have an increased risk for retinal
      detachment. Other ocular anomalies (e.g. coloboma of iris microcornea nystagmus
      strabismus microphthalmos) are usually associated however it may also be isolated.
