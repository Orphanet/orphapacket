  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare secondary interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by development
      of the condition after exposure to certain drugs or radiation therapy. Diagnostic
      criteria include clear temporal association identification of a characteristic
      reaction pattern to the respective drug and exclusion of other causes of the
      ILD. Clinically drug-induced ILD (DI-ILD) may occur as acute ILD with respiratory
      failure or as subacute/chronic DI-ILD. Radiation injury to the lung can develop
      during or following radiation therapy and depends on the nature and dose of
      the ionizing radiation as well as the direction of the radiation beam.
