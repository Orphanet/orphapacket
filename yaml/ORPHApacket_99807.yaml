      by progressive encephalopathy early-onset seizures with a hypsarrhythmic pattern
      facial and limb edema severe hypotonia early arrest of psychomotor development
      and craniofacial dysmorphism (evolving microcephaly narrow forehead short nose
      prominent auricles open mouth micrognathia) in the absence of neuro-ophthalmic
