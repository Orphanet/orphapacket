  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by neonatal diabetes mellitus
      associated with cerebellar and/or pancreatic agenesis. Absence or hypoplasia
      of the cerebellum and severe intra-uterine growth retardation can be detected
      prenatally. Patients also present with facial dysmorphism (a triangular face
      small chin low set ears) flexion contractures of the arms and legs very little
      subcutaneous fat and optic nerve hypoplasia. The disease is lethal in the neonatal
      period.
