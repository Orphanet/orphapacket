    Contents: A rare genetic skin disease characterized by infantile onset of diffuse
      alopecia abnormal skin pigmentation (hypo- and hyperpigmented macules of the
      trunk and face and areas of reticular hypo- and hyperpigmentation of the extremities)
      palmoplantar keratoderma and nail dystrophy. Patients develop recurrent spinocellular
      carcinomas later in life. Brittle teeth resulting in early loss of dentition
      have also been described.
