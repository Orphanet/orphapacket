  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign primary bone dysplasia characterized by progressive replacement
      of normal bone and marrow with fibrous connective tissue in either one (monostotic)
      or multiple (polyostotic) bones. Clinical manifestations depend on the anatomic
      location of the replacement and may include bone pain deformities pathological
      fractures and cranial nerve deficits.
