  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by large and late-closing fontanels (the anterior fontanel may not completely
      ossify in adulthood) associated with facial dysmorphism and mild generalized
      skeletal dysplasia. Patients usually present with short stature significant
      hypertelorism and eye abnormalities (early onset cataract and other lens abnormalities
      esotropia optic atrophy). Associated facial features include abnormal hair (sparce
      and brittle) hyperpigmentation with capillary hemangioma on the forehead macrocephaly
      frontal bossing wide nasal bridge long philtrum large mouth thin vermilion high
      arched palate and abnormal dentition. Other associated morphological abnormalities
      include vertebral wedging with scoliosis high and narrow iliac wings pectus
      excavatum joint hypermobility and flat feet.
