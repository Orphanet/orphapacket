  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 15 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      onset in infancy or early childhood of muscular hypotonia gait ataxia mild bilateral
      pyramidal tract signs developmental delay (affecting mostly speech and coordination)
      and subsequent intellectual disability. Short stature obesity microcephaly strabismus
      nystagmus reduced visual acuity lactic acidosis and a brain neuropathology consistent
      with Leigh syndrome are also reported.
