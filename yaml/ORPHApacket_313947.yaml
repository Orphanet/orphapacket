  TextSection:
    Contents: 2q23.1 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 2 primarily
      characterized by global developmental delay hypotonia autistic-like features
      and behavioural problems. Craniofacial dysmorphism (arched eyebrows hypertelorism
      bilateral ptosis prominent nose wide mouth micro/retrognathia) and an affable
      personality are also commonly associated. Minor digital anomalies (fifth finger
      clinodactyly and large broad first toe) have occasionally been reported.
