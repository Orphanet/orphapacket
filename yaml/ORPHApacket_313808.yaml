    Contents: A rare leukodystrophy characterized by progressive cognitive impairment
      neuropsychiatric features motor dysfunction involving parkinsonian symptoms
      gait disturbances spasticity and speech impairment. Epilepsy stroke-like episodes
      sensory dysfunction dizziness fatigue urinary and fecal incontinence are commonly
      observed in affected individuals. Neuroaxonal spheroids and pigmented (iron
      or lipofuscin) macrophages and glial cells together with diffuse myelin loss
      and axonal destruction are major histopathological hallmarks.
