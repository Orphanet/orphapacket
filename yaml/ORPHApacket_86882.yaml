    Contents: A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by a proliferation
      of cytotoxic T-cells usually gamma delta T-cells with involvement of the liver
      and spleen but without involvement of lymph nodes. The bone marrow is consistently
      affected. Patients typically present during adolescence or young adulthood with
      hepatosplenomegaly pancytopenia and systemic symptoms. Peripheral blood involvement
      may develop later in the disease course. There is a clear male preponderance.
      The disease often occurs in the context of long-term immunosuppression. The
      course is aggressive with poor therapy response.
