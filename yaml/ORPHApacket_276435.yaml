  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic motor neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive
      predominantly proximal muscular weakness and atrophy which typically manifests
      with muscle cramps fasciculations decreased/absent deep tendon reflexes hand
      tremor and elevated serum creatine kinase at onset and later associates with
      reduced walking ability and impaired vibration sensation.
