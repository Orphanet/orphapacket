    Contents: A rare syndrome with combined immunodeficiency characterized by intrauterine
      and postnatal growth retardation chronic neutropenia and natural killer (NK)
      cell deficiency due a defect in DNA replication leading to blockade of immune

      clinical features include recurrent viral and bacterial infections and eczema
      as well as mild facial dysmorphism.
