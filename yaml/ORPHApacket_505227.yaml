    Contents: A rare syndrome with combined immunodeficiency characterized by intrauterine
      and postnatal growth retardation chronic neutropenia and natural killer (NK)
      cell deficiency due a defect in DNA replication leading to blockade of immune
      cell differentiation in the bone marrow particularly affecting NK cells. Other
      clinical features include recurrent viral and bacterial infections and eczema
      as well as mild facial dysmorphism.
