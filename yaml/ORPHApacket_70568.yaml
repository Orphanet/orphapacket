  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders
      characterized by lymphoid or plasmacytic proliferations developing in the context
      of immunosuppression in a recipient of a solid organ or stem cell allograft.
      The group includes non-destructive post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders
      (PTLDs) polymorphic PTLD monomorphic PTLDs and classic Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD.
      Patients may have more than one type of PTLD in a single or in different locations.
      The most commonly involved sites are lymph nodes gastrointestinal tract lungs
      and liver although the disease may occur almost anywhere in the body. In solid
      organ transplant recipients PTLD may also involve the allograft.
