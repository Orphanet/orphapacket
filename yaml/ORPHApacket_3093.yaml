    Contents: A rare aortic malformation of variable severity and clinical presentation.
      Clinical presentations range from a neonatal severe presentation often associated
      with sudden cardiac death to a slowly progressive stenosis that presents later
      with cardiac murmur chest pain dizziness and loss of consciousness with exercise-induced
      exacerbations. Echocardiography reveals atresia or dysplasia of the aortic valve
      most commonly associated with a bicuspid morphology restricted left ventricular
      outflow and left ventricular hypertrophy.
