  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease characterized by acute or subacute onset of
      thrombocytopenia anasarca (edema pleural effusion ascites) and systemic inflammation
      (fever and/or elevated C-reactive protein). Minor diagnostic categories are
      Castleman's disease-like features on lymph node biopsy reticulin myelofibrosis
      and/or increased number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow progressive renal insufficiency
      and mild organomegaly including hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy. Most
      patients show elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase while marked polyclonal
      hypergammopathy is rare.
