      adenoma) biphasic (metanephric adenofibroma) or renal stromal (metanephric stromal
      tumor) neoplasm. Metanephric adenoma mostly occurs in the fifth to sixth decade
      of life with distinct female predominance. It may be asymptomatic or present
      with abdominal pain hematuria and/or polycythemia. Metanephric adenofibroma
      has been described from infancy to young adulthood potentially causing polycythemia
