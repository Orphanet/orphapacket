  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare locally aggressive cutaneous or visceral vascular tumor characterized
      by either superficial lesions presenting as blue-purple infiltrated ill-defined
      plaques or deep lesions usually manifesting with coagulation abnormality. They
      are associated in about 3 out of 4 of cases with potentially lethal thrombocytopenia
      and consumption coagulopathy (Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon; KMP).
