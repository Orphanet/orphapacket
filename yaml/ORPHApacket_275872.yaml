  TextSection:
    Contents: Frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease (FTD-MND) is a type
      of frontotemporal lobar degeneration characterized by the insidious onset (between
      the ages of 38-78 years) of dementia-associated psychiatric symptoms (e.g. personality
      changes uninhibited behavior irritability aggressiveness) memory difficulties
      global intellectual impairment emotional disorders and transcortical motor aphasia
      that eventually leads to mutism in addition to the manifestations of motor neuron
      disease such as neurogenic muscular wasting (similar to what is seen in amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis; see this term). The disease is progressive with death occurring
      2-5 years after onset.
