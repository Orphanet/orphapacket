  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare severe genetic neurometabolic disorder associated with clinical
      manifestations related to impaired synthesis of dopamine noradrenaline adrenaline
      and serotonin. Clinical manifestations are typically characterized by early-onset
      muscular hypotonia movement disorders (oculogyric crisis dystonia) developmental
      delay ptosis and non-motor symptoms (sleep disturbance irritability excessive
      sweating and nasal congestion).
