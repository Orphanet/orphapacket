  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased
      susceptibility to recurrent usually severe infections (particularly by <i>Neisseria
      meningitidis</i> <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>)
      typically manifesting as otitis sinusitis bronchitis pneumonia and/or meningitis.
      Autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus glomerulonephritis) and
      atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome may be associated. Laboratory serum analysis
      reveals in addition to diminished or undetectable complement factor I variably
      decreased complement C3 complement factor B and complement factor H.
