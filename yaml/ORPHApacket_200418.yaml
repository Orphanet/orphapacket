  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunodeficiency with factor I anomaly is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency
      disease characterized by increased susceptibility to recurrent usually severe
      infections (particularly by <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>
      and <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>) typically manifesting as otitis sinusitis
      bronchitis pneumonia and/or meningitis. Autoimmune disease (e.g. systemic lupus
      erythematosus glomerulonephritis) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome may
      be associated. Laboratory serum analysis reveals in addition to diminished or
      undetectable complement factor I variably decreased complement C3 complement
      factor B and complement factor H.
