    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency characterized by profound circulating
      monocytopenia B- and NK-cell lymphopenia and severe dentritic cell decrease
      which manifests clinically with disseminated mycobacterial and viral infections
      as well as opportunistic fungal and parasitic infections and frequent pulmonary
      alveolar proteinosis. Predisposition to developping myeloid neoplasms is associated.
