  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of folate metabolism and transport characterized biochemically
      by elevated formiminoglutamate in urine and plasma due to glutamate formiminotransferase
      deficiency associated with a highly variable clinical phenotype ranging from
      developmental delay intellectual disability and anemia to normal development
      without anemia. Increased hydantoin-5-propionic acid and/or folate in plasma
      may also be associated.
