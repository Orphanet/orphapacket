  TextSection:
    Contents: Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) is an age-related epileptic encephalopathy
      where developmental regression occurs mainly in the language domain and the
      electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities are mainly localized around the
      temporal-parietal regions. The term acquired epileptic aphasia describes the
      main features of this condition.
