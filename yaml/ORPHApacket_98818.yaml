  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of epileptic encephalopathy with spike-wave activation in
      sleep (EE-SWAS) characterized by various combinations of acquired cognitive
      language behavioral and motor deficits associated with marked spike- and- wave
      activation in sleep. In Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS) receptive language is
      mainly affected with an acquired auditory verbal agnosia.
