  TextSection:
    Contents: Interventricular septum aneurysm is a rare non-syndromic congenital
      heart malformation characterized by the presence of a congenital aneurysm of
      the membranous portion of the interventricular septum. Patients may be asymptomatic
      or may present with ventricular or supraventricular tachycardia fatigue exertional
      dyspnea palpitations and cardiac murmur. Ventricular septal defects and conduction
      defects such as first-degree atrio-ventricular block or incomplete right bundle
      branch block may also be also associated.
