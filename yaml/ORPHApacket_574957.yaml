  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent atypical
      mycobacterial infections accompanied by relatively minor viral infections on
      an immunological background of reduced induction of expression of interferon-regulated
      genes and dysregulated cytokine production as revealed by laboratory studies.
      Global developmental delay and occurrence of non-hematopoietic malignancy at
      a young age have been reported in association.
