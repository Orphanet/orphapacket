  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated hereditary congenital facial paralysis (IHCFP) is an extremely
      rare neurological disorder presumed to result from maldevelopment of the facial
      nucleus and/or cranial nerve and has been reported in fewer than 10 families
      to date. It manifests as non-progressive isolated unilateral or bilateral symmetrical
      or asymmetrical facial palsy. Involvement of the branches of the facial nerve
      can be unequal.
