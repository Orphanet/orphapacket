  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that presents
      a highly variable age of onset and phenotypic spectrum typically characterized
      by slowly progressive proximal weakness of the pelvic and shoulder girdle musculature
      (predominantly affecting the lower limbs) frequently associated with waddling
      gait scapular winging calf and tongue hypertrophy exercise-induced myalgia abdominal
      muscle weakness cardiomyopathy respiratory muscle involvement and myoglobinuria
      and/or elevated creatine kinase serum levels.
