    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that
      presents a highly variable age of onset and phenotypic spectrum typically characterized
      by slowly progressive proximal weakness of the pelvic and shoulder girdle musculature
      (predominantly affecting the lower limbs) frequently associated with waddling
      gait scapular winging calf and tongue hypertrophy exercise-induced myalgia and
      myoglobinuria and/or elevated creatine kinase serum levels. Abdominal muscle
      weakness cardiomyopathy respiratory muscle involvement and various brain abnormalities
      have also been reported.
