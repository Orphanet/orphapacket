  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic limb reduction defects syndrome characterized by bilateral
      radial aplasia/hypoplasia manifesting with absent/short forearms in association
      with anogenital abnormalities (e.g. hypospadias or imperforate anus). Additional
      features reported include hydrocephalus and absent preaxial digits. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1993.
