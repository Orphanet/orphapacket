  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability-alacrima-achalasia syndrome is a rare genetic
      intellectual disability syndrome characterized by delayed motor and cognitive
      development absence or severe delay in speech development intellectual disability
      and alacrima. Achalasia/dysphagia and mild autonomic dysfunction (i.e. anisocoria)
      have also been reported in some patients. The phenotype is similar to the one
      observed in autosomal recessive Triple A syndrome but differs by the presence
      of intellectual disability in all affected individuals.
