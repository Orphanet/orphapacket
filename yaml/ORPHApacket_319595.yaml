  TextSection:
    Contents: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to partial
      STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) deficiency is a genetic
      variant of MSMD (see this term) characterized by a partial defect in the interferon
      (IFN)-gamma pathway leading to mild mycobacterial infections.
