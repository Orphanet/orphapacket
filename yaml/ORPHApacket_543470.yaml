  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by a variable clinical phenotype
      with the core features of optic atrophy ataxia and hypotonia. Additional common
      manifestations include global developmental delay with or without regression
      neuropathy spasticity and microcephaly less frequently seizures movement disorder
      hearing loss and respiratory failure. Brain imaging may show abnormalities of
      the corpus callosum basal ganglia and midbrain cerebral or cerebellar atrophy
      or white matter abnormalities. The condition is frequently fatal at an early
      age.
