  TextSection:
    Contents: 17p11.2 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 17 typically
      characterized by hypotonia poor feeding failure to thrive developmental delay
      (particularly cognitive and language deficits) mild-moderate intellectual deficit
      and neuropsychiatric disorders (behavioral problems anxiety attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder autistic spectrum disorder bipolar disorder). Structural
      cardiovascular anomalies (dilated aortic root bicommissural aortic valve atrial/ventricular
      and septal defects) and sleep disturbance (obstructive and central sleep apnea)
      are also frequently associated.
