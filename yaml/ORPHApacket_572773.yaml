  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized
      by severe microcephaly intrauterine growth retardation short stature and variable
      limb anomalies such as radial ray defects short limbs absent/hypoplastic patellae
      syndactyly brachydactyly and hypoplastic carpal or metacarpal bones. Craniofacial
      dysmorphism is characterized by long and broad nose microstomia and micrognathia.
      Intellectual disability is mild when present. Cases with extremely severe phenotype
      with very short limbs and poor lung development are perinatally lethal.
