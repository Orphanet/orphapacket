  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic respiratory disease characterized by infantile onset
      of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients have
      normal respiratory function at birth but subsequently develop recurrent mainly
      viral infections and progressive respiratory failure often leading to death
      in infancy or early childhood. Additional reported features include leukocytosis
      and splenomegaly.
