    Contents: Global developmental delay-lung cysts-overgrowth-Wilms tumor syndrome
      is a rare genetic overgrowth syndrome characterized by global developmental
      delay macrosomia with subsequent somatic overgrowth bilateral cystic lung lesions
      congenital nephromegaly and bilateral Wilms tumor. Craniofacial dysmorphism
      includes macrocephaly frontal bossing large anterior fontanelle mild hypertelorism
      ear pit flat nasal bridge anteverted nares and mild micrognathia. Additional
      features may include brain and skeletal anomalies enlarged protuberant abdomen
      fat pads on dorsum of feet and toes and rugated soles with skin folds as well
      as umbilical/inguinal hernia and autistic behavior.
