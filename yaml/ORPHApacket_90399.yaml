    Contents: Localized lichen myxedematosus with monoclonal gammopathy or systemic
      symptoms is a form of atypical lichen myxedematosus (see this term) characterized
      by the appearance of several 2-4 mm erythematous waxy papules confined to a
      few sites that may be associated with either an immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy
      in patients with acral persistent papular mucinosis; discrete papular lichen
      myxedematosus (see these terms); a scleromyxedema-like involvement with dysphagia
      hoarseness pulmonary involvement and carpal tunnel syndrome; myositis without
      skin sclerosis; or paraproteinemia.
