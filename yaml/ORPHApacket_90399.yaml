      symptoms is a form of atypical lichen myxedematosus characterized by the appearance
      of several 2-4 mm erythematous waxy papules confined to a few sites that may

      with acral persistent papular mucinosis; discrete papular lichen myxedematosus;
      a scleromyxedema-like involvement with dysphagia hoarseness pulmonary involvement
