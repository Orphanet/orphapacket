  TextSection:
    Contents: An extremely rare type of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita characterized
      by the combination of multiple joint contractures with movement limitation microstomia
      with a whistling appearance of the mouth that may cause feeding swallowing and
      speech difficulties a distinctive expressionless facies severe developmental
      delay central and autonomous nervous system dysfunction (excessive salivation
      temperature instability myoclonic epileptic fits bradycardia) occasionally Pierre-Robin
      sequence and lethality generally occurring during the first months of life.
      Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita-whistling face syndrome has been suggested
      to be a fetal akinesia deformation sequence.
