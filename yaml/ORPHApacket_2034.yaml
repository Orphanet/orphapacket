  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A parasitic disease caused by tissue-invasive vector-borne nematodes
      which can be found anywhere in the human body and that are transmitted to humans
      through the bite of an infected mosquito or fly or by consumption of unsafe
      drinking water and which depending on the subtype can manifest with lymphedema
      dermatitis subcutaneous edema and eye involvement. The disorder is a major public
      health problem in many tropical and subtropical countries. Six subtypes have
      been described in the literature: lymphatic filariasis onchocerciasis loiasis
      mansonelliasis dirofilariasis and dracunculiasis caused by <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i>
      and filarioidea of the genus <i>Brugia</i>; <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i>; <i>Loa
      loa</i>; <i>Mansonella</i>; <i>Dirofilaria</i>; and <i>Dracunculus medinensis</i>
      respectively. Tropical eosinophilia is considered a frequent manifestation.'
