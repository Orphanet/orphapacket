  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability-brachydactyly-Pierre Robin syndrome is a rare
      developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by mild to
      moderate intellectual disability and phsychomotor delay Robin sequence (incl.
      severe micrognathia and soft palate cleft) and distinct dysmorphic facial features
      (e.g. synophris short palpebral fissures hypertelorism small low-set and posteriorly
      angulated ears bulbous nose long/flat philtrum and bow-shaped upper lip). Skeletal
      anomalies such as brachydactyly clinodactyly small hands and feet and oral manifestations
      (e.g. bifid short tongue oligodontia) are also associated. Additional features
      reported include microcephaly capillary hemangiomas on face and scalp ventricular
      septal defect corneal clouding nystagmus and profound sensorineural deafness.
