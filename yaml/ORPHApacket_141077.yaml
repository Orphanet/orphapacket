  TextSection:
    Contents: Epignathus is a very rare and life threatening intraoral teratoma usually
      arising from the maxilla mandible palate or base of skull and invading the cranium
      nasopharynx or oral cavity. Epignathus is more commonly seen in females and
      presents with various manifestations (depending on the tumor size) including
      obstructive polyhydramnios in the prenatal period and dyspnea cyanosis cough
      difficulty in sucking and swallowing and rarely vomiting (due to swallowing
      difficulties) postnatally. When large they can lead to airway obstruction asphyxia
      and death in the neonatal period.
