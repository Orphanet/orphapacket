  TextSection:
    Contents: Postaxial tetramelic oligodactyly is a rare genetic congenital limb
      malformation disorder characterized by isolated postaxial oligodactyly in all
      four extremities. Patients present a consistent pattern of malformation ranging
      from complete absence of the 5th metacarpals metatarsals and phalanges to complete
      absence of the 5th metacarpals and metatarsals with some residual distal 5th
      phalanges. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1993.
