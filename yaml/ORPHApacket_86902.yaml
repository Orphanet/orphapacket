  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dendritic cell neoplasm characterized by a proliferation of spindled
      to ovoid cells with morphological and immunophenotypic features of follicular
      dendritic cells. Conventional follicular dendritic cell sarcomas are negative
      for EBV. The tumor arises as a painless slow-growing mass in lymph nodes (most
      often cervical) extranodal sites (such as tonsils gastrointestinal tract soft
      tissue mediastinum or lung among others) or both. Paraneoplastic pemphigus may
      occur in rare cases. Predictive factors are tumor size presence of coagulative
      necrosis mitotic count and presence of significant cytological atypia.
