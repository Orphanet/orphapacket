  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare thoracic malformation characterized by fixation of the scapula
      to the first rib by a congenitally short costocoracoid ligament leading to limited
      rotation or retraction of the scapula as well as rounding of the shoulders and
      loss of the anterior clavicular contour. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1989.
