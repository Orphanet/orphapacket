    Contents: A rare chromosomal anomaly characterized by a combination of paternal
      uniparental and biparental cell lineages leading to variable clinical presentation
      that predominantly includes features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and increased
      risk of various tumors. In addition features of Angelman syndrome and transient
      neonatal diabetes might be expected.
