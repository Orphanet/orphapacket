  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic adrenal disease characterized by primary adrenal insufficiency
      (AI) and/or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Male patients typically present
      with AI with acute onset in infancy or insidious onset in childhood. Clinical
      features of AI include hyperpigmentation vomiting poor feeding failure to thrive
      seizures vascular collapse and sometimes sudden death. HH manifests later as
      delayed or arrested puberty. In rare cases patients become symptomatic in early
      adulthood with delayed-onset AI partial HH and/or infertility. Histologically
      the adrenal glands lack the permanent adult cortical zone. The remaining cells
      are larger than fetal adrenal cells (''cytomegalic'') and contain characteristic
      nuclear inclusions.
