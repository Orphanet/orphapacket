    Contents: Foetal parvovirus syndrome is a foetopathy likely to occur when a pregnant
      woman is infected by parvovirus B19. In adults the virus causes a butterfly
      erythema infectiosum (also called Fifth Disease; 'slapped cheek disease') and
      flu-like symptoms with symmetric polyarthralgias which usually do not warrant
      prenatal diagnosis.
