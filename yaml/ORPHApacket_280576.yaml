  TextSection:
    Contents: Nestor-Guillermo progeria syndrome is a rare genetic progeroid syndrome
      characterized by a prematurely aged appearance associated with severe osteolysis
      (notably on mandible clavicles ribs distal phalanges and long bones) osteoporosis
      generalized lipoatrophy and absence of cardiovascular atherosclerotic and metabolic
      complications presenting a relatively long survival. Additional characteristics
      include growth retardation joint stiffness (mainly of fingers hands knees and
      elbows) wide cranial sutures dysmorphic facial features (prominent eyes convex
      nasal ridge malocclusion dental crowding thin lip vermillion microretrognathia)
      and persistent eyebrows eyelashes and scalp hair.
