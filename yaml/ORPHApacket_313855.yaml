    Contents: FGFR2-related bent bone dysplasia is a rare genetic lethal primary bone
      dysplasia characterized by dysmorphic craniofacial features (low-set posteriorly
      rotated ears hypertelorism megalophtalmos flattened and hypoplastic midface
      micrognathia) hypomineralization of the calvarium craniosynostosis hypoplastic
      clavicles and pubis and bent long bones (particularly involving the femora)

      with extramedullary hematopoiesis may also be associated.
