      dysplasia characterized by dysmorphic craniofacial features (low-set posteriorly
      rotated ears hypertelorism megalophtalmos flattened and hypoplastic midface
      micrognathia) hypomineralization of the calvarium craniosynostosis hypoplastic
      clavicles and pubis and bent long bones (particularly involving the femora)
