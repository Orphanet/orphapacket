    Contents: A rare acquired skeletal muscle disease characterized by infiltration
      of the epimysium perimysium and perifascicular endomysium by macrophages with
      crystal inclusions composed of aluminum salts at the site of a previous vaccination
      (most commonly the deltoid muscle). Muscle necrosis is typically absent. Patients
      may present with myalgias arthralgias muscle weakness chronic fatigue asthenia
      fever and cognitive dysfunction. Signs and symptoms usually develop slowly over
      several months.
