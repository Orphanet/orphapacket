  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by infiltrates of IgG4-positive
      plasma cells and lymphocytes in the adventitia of the aorta resulting in thickening
      of perivascular tissue or formation of soft tissue masses surrounding the aorta
      and its major branches (potentially complicated by inflammatory aortic aneurysm)
      associated with elevated serum IgG4 levels. Preferential location is the infra-renal
      portion of the abdominal aorta. In addition medium-sized blood vessels can be
      involved and the condition may occur together with IgG4-related disease in other
      parts of the body. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and include chest or back
      pain and fever.
