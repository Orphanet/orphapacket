  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect of the eye characterized by a uni-
      or bilateral abnormal lens shape (contraction of the lens with a notch) due
      to segmentally defective or absent development of the zonule and flattening
      of the equator in the region of the zonular defect typically manifesting with
      reduced visual acuity. Other ocular anomalies such as iris choroid or optic
      disc colobomas as well as cataracts and retinal detachment may be associated.
