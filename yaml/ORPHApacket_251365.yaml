  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by anemia reticulocytosis
      and erythrocyte abnormalities including target cells irreversibly sickled cells
      and crystal-containing cells. Clinical course is similar to sickle cell disease
      but less severe and with less complications. Signs and symptoms may include
      acute episodes of pain splenic infarction and splenic sequestration crisis acute
      chest syndrome focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ischemic brain injury peripheral
