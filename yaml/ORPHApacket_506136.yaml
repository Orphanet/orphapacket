  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of esophageal epithelial neoplasms characterized by neuroendocrine
      differentiation comprising well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)
      poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine
      neoplasms an umbrella category including mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma.
      The tumors typically occur in the lower esophagus often in association with
      Barrett mucosa. NECs may also arise in other parts of the esophagus. On endoscopy
      NETs usually appear as small polypoid or nodular submucosal masses while NECs
      are large infiltrative and ulcerated. Patients most commonly present with dysphagia
      pain weight loss and sometimes melena. Metastatic NETs may be associated with
      carcinoid syndrome.
