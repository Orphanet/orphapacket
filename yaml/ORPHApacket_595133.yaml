    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by distinctive perivascular epitheloid
      cells often arranged radially around a vascular lumen as well as spindled cells
      in variable proportion. Melanocytic and muscle markers are typically positive.
      The tumors have been reported in the uterus falciform ligament and large and
      small intestine among others. Depending on their location they may present as
      a painful or painless mass or with vaginal bleeding. Tumors displaying infiltrative
      growth marked hypercellularity nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia high mitotic
      activity atypical mitotic figures and/or coagulative necrosis should be regarded
      as malignant.
