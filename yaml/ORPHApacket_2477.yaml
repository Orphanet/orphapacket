    Contents: A rare central nervous system malformation characterized by an abnormally
      large brain accompanied by abnormal head circumference measurements evident
      at birth or developing over the first years of life. The condition can be unilateral
      or bilateral and affects males more often than females. There is no typical
      pattern of symptoms but mental retardation seizures and other neurologic abnormalities
      have been reported.
