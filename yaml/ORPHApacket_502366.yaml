  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a firm infiltrative neoplasm
      with squamous differentiation most commonly arising at the vermilion border
      of the lower lip. Patients present with a usually asymptomatic lesion of variable
      appearance such as ulceration a focus of whitish thickening a dry atrophic area
      or an area of persistent chapping and localized flaking and crusting. Carcinomas
      of the lower lip tend to progress slowly (as opposed to those of the upper lip).
      Invasion of adjacent structures including perineural spread is typical with
      a variable rate of metastasis depending on the location.
