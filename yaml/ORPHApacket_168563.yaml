  TextSection:
    Contents: "46,XY gonadal dysgenesis-motor and sensory neuropathy syndrome is a\
      \ rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized\
      \ by partial (unilateral testis persistence of M\xFCllerian duct structures)\
      \ or complete (streak gonads only) gonadal dysgenesis usually manifesting with\
      \ primary amenorrhea in individuals with female phenotype but 46,XY karyotype\
      \ and sensorimotor dysmyelinating minifascicular polyneuropathy which presents\
      \ with numbness weakness exercise-induced muscle cramps sensory disturbances\
      \ and reduced/absent deep tendon reflexes. Germ cell tumors (seminoma dysgerminoma\
      \ gonadoblastoma) may develop from the gonadal tissue."
