  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by varying
      degrees of malformation of the inner ear associated with severe to profound
      congenital sensorineural hearing loss in the absence of cochlear nerve anomalies
      (hypoplasia or aplasia). Categorization of the malformation is based on the
      morphology of the cochlea modiolus and lamina cribrosa which can range from
      normal development of these structures (with the malformation being limited
      to other structures of the inner ear) to their complete absence.
