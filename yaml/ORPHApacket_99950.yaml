  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4D (CMT4D) is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease type 4 characterized by a childhood-onset of severe progressive demyelinating
      sensorimotor neuropathy manifesting with distal muscle weakness and atrophy
      sensorineural hearing impairment leading to deafness (usually in third decade)
      severely reduced nerve conduction velocities and skeletal especially foot deformities.
      Tongue atrophy has also been reported.
