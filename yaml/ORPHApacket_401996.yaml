  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic renal disease characterized by slowly progressive chronic
      tubulointerstitial nephritis leading to end-stage renal disease before the age
      of 50 years manifesting with mild proteinuria glucosuria and occasionally urinary
      sediment abnormalities (mainly hematuria). Mild extrarenal manifestations such
      as recurrent upper respiratory tract infections and abnormal liver function
      tests may be associated. Renal biopsy reveals severe chronic interstitial fibrosis
      and tubular changes as well as hallmark karyomegalic tubular epithelial cells
      which line the proximal and distal tubules and have enlarged hyperchromatic
      nuclei.
