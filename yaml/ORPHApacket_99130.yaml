  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital partial agenesis of pericardium is a rare mostly asymptomatic
      congenital heart malformation mainly characterized by the partial absence of
      the left pericardium. It is occasionally associated with chest pain or dyspnea
      and is usually incidentally diagnosed during surgery or at autopsy. Herniation
      and strangulation of a portion of the heart through the pericardial foramen
      may occur resulting in myocardial acute ischemia and possible sudden death.
      Right side pericardium involvement is rare.
