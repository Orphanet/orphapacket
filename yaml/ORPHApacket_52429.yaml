  TextSection:
    Contents: Branchiootic syndrome is a rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies
      syndrome characterized by second branchial arch anomalies (branchial cysts and
      fistulae) malformations of the outer middle and inner ear associated with sensorineural
      mixed or conductive hearing loss and the absence of renal abnormalities. Typical
      ear findings consist of malformed auricles (e.g. lop or cupped ears) preauricular
      pits and/or tags and middle and/or inner ear dysplasias (inculding cochlear
      vestibular and semicircular channel hypoplasia malformation of the ossicles
      and of middle ear space).
