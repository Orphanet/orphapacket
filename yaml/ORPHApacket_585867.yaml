  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with recurrent genetic anomaly characterized
      by the presence of bone marrow and peripheral blood myeloblasts with features
      ranging from those of minimal differentiation to granulocytic maturation demonstrating
      t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) or molecular genetic evidence of BCR-ABL1 fusion. Evidence
      of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is absent. Patients most commonly present
      with leukocytosis with blast predominance and variable anemia and thrombocytopenia.
      Splenomegaly is less frequent and peripheral blood basophilia lower than in
      patients with myeloid blast transformation of CML. The disease occurs primarily
      in adults and response to traditional AML therapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      therapy alone is typically poor.
