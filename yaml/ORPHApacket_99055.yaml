  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital anomaly of the tricuspid subvalvular apparatus characterized
      by aberrant tendinous chords which insert at the clear zone of the leaflet instead
      of its free edge and connect to the endocardium instead of the papillary muscles.
      Resulting tethering of one or more tricuspid leaflets leads to their impaired
      mobility and tricuspid regurgitation. Association with other congenital cardiac
      anomalies has been reported.
