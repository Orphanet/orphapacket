  TextSection:
    Contents: Myosclerosis is a rare genetic non-dystrophic myopathy characterized
      by early diffuse progressive muscle and joint contractures that result in severe
      limitation of movement of axial proximal and distal joints walking difficulties
      in early childhood and toe walking. Patients typically present thin sclerotic
      muscles with a woody consistency mild girdle and proximal limb weakness with
      moderate distal weakness and scoliosis. Muscle biopsy shows partial collagen
      VI deficiency at the myofiber basement membrane and absent collagen VI around
      most endomysial/perimysial capillaries.
