    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a nodular lesion composed
      of cells closely resembling the modified smooth muscle cells of the normal glomus
      body. The tumors most often arise in the skin or soft tissues of the distal
      extremities in particular the subungual region but have been reported in almost
      any location. They occur as typical glomus tumors glomangiomatosis (multiple
      nodules of solid glomus tumor investing the vascular walls) symplastic (showing
      striking nuclear atypia without mitotic activity or necrosis) or malignant glomus
      tumors and glomus tumors of uncertain malignant potential.
