  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic premature ovarian failure characterized by decreased
      abnormal or loss of ovarian function prior to age 40 in women bearing a premutation
      in <i>FMR1</i> gene defined as an expansion of 55-200 CGG repeats in the 5'
      untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Clinical features include irregular or
      absent menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) irregular ovulation and altered hormone
      profile (hypoestrogenism and elevated serum gonadotropin levels) associated
      to fragile X premutation. Most of the patients have fertility problems (subfertility
      or infertility) and undergo early menopause.
