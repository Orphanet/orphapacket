  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare 46,XY difference of sex development due to impaired androgen
      production characterized by impaired normal male sexual development. The severity
      of the disorder varies and can manifest in its severe form with complete 46,XY
      male pseudohermaphroditism including low testosterone and high luteinizing hormone
      levels absent development of secondary male sex characteristics and lack of
      breast development. Patients with the milder form can have a wider range of
      phenotypes ranging from micropenis to severe hypospadias.
