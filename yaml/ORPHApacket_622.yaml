  TextSection:
    Contents: Homocystinuria without methylmalonic aciduria is an inborn error of
      vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism characterized by megaloblastic anemia encephalopathy
      and sometimes developmental delay and associated with homocystinuria and hyperhomocysteinemia.
      There are three types of homocystinuria without methylmalonic aciduria; <i>cblE
      cblG</i> and <i>cblD-</i>variant 1 (<i>cblD</i>v1).
