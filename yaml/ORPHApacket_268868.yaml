  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare central nervous system malformation characterized by congenital
      absence of the spinal cord usually associated with segmental bony spinal anomalies.
      Neurologic deficits depend on the affected segments and the functioning of the
      residual spinal cord. Typically the spinal cord appears normal above the defect
      and bulky thickened and low-lying caudally. Clinical presentation includes varying
      degrees of motor weakness (associated with deformities of the lower limbs) and
      neurogenic bladder dysfunction.
