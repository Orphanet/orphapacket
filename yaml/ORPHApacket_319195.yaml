  TextSection:
    Contents: Chondroectodermal dysplasia with night blindness is a rare genetic bone
      development disorder characterized by proportionate short stature nail dysplasia
      (enlarged convex hypertrophic nails) hypodontia and night blindness. Osteopenia
      a tendency to present fractures talipes varus with abnormal gait ear infections
      and watering eyes due to narrow tear ducts are frequently associated. Radiologically
      patients present delayed bone age on wrist X-rays platyspondyly and broad metaphyses
      of humeri with dense and thickened growth plates.
