  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic pigmentation anomaly of the skin characterized by generalized
      irregularly shaped asymptomatic hyper- and hypopigmented macules distributed
      in a reticular pattern involving the trunk limbs and sometimes the face. The
      palms soles and mucosa are usually not affected. Systemic abnormalities have
      been rarely reported.
