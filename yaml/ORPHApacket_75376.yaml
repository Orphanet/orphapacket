  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic macular dystrophy disorder characterized by the presence
      of small yellow-white accumulations of extracellular material under the retinal
      pigment epithelium in the ocular posterior pole and affecting multiple members
      of a family. The disease has a variable clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic
      patients to progressive loss of vision and scotomas possibly associated with
      subfoveal choroidal neovascularization extensive pigmentary changes geographic
