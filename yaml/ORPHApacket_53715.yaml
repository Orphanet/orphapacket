    Contents: 'Tumoral calcinosis is a phosphocalcic metabolism anomaly particularly
      among younger age groups and characterized by the presence of calcified masses
      in the juxta-articular regions (hip elbow ankle and scapula) without joint involvement.
      Histologically lesions display collagen necrobiosis followed by cyst formation
      and a foreign-body response with calcification Two forms of tumoral calcinosis
      have been described: normocalcemic tumoral calcinosis and familial tumoral calcinosis.'
