  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A phosphocalcic metabolism anomaly occuring particularly among younger
      age groups characterized by the presence of calcified masses in the juxta-articular
      regions (hip elbow ankle and scapula) without joint involvement. Histologically
      lesions display collagen necrobiosis followed by cyst formation and a foreign-body
      response with calcification. Two forms have been described: normocalcemic tumoral
      calcinosis and familial tumoral calcinosis.'
