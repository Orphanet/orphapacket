  TextSection:
    Contents: Glioependymal/ependymal cyst is a rare central nervous system malformation
      defined as a subarachnoid supratentorial interventricular or intraspinal sometimes
      intracerebral or intramedullar cyst with an internal ependymal lining possibly
      surrounded by glial tissue. It may be an incidental finding or may present at
      different ages with clinical features depending on its size and location. It
      may distort adjacent brain structures and cause macrocephaly ventriculomegaly
      hydrocephalus focal neurological signs and other signs and symptoms. In some
      cases it is associated with other cerebral malformations (e.g. corpus callosum
      agenesis polymicrogyria heterotopias).
