  TextSection:
    Contents: Finnish upper limb-onset distal myopathy is a rare genetic distal myopathy
      characterized by slowly progressive distal to proximal limb muscle weakness
      and atrophy with characteristic early involvement of thenar and hypothenar muscles.
      Patients present with clumsiness of the hands and stumbling in the fourth to
      fifth decade of life and later develop steppage gait and contractures of the
      hands. Progressive fatty degeneration affects intrinsic muscles of the hands
      gluteus medium and both anterior and posterior compartment muscles of the distal
      lower extremities with later involvement of forearm muscles triceps infraspinatus
      and the proximal lower limb muscles. Asymmetry of muscle involvement is common.
