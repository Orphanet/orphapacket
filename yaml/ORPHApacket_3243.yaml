  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inflammatory disease characterized by abrupt appearance of painful
      edematous and erythematous papules plaques and nodules on the skin and frequently
      accompanied by fever and neutrophilia with a dense infiltration of mature neutrophils
      that are typically located in the upper dermis. The disease is classically associated
      with inflammatory disease pregnancy infection (mostly of the upper respiratory
      tract) or vaccination but may be idiopathic associated with a hematological
      or visceral malignancy or drug-induced.
