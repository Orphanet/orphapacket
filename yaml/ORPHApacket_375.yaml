  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare fulminant small vessel vasculitis that affects the capillary
      beds of the kidneys and lungs and characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular
      basement membrane (GBM) and in its full-blown form anti-alveolar basement membrane
      (ABM) antibodies. Consequently it may manifest as a rapidly progressive isolated
      glomerulonephritis (anti-GBM nephritis) or as a pulmonary-renal syndrome with
      severe lung hemorrhage.
