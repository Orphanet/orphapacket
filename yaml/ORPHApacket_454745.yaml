  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired human prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive
      fatal neurodegeneration caused by the consumption of prion-containing tissue
      in endocannibalistic funeral rituals in Papua New Guinea until the late 1950s.
      After a decades-long asymptomatic period and a non-specific prodromal phase
      with headaches and arthralgia the most prominent neurological feature is ataxia
      in addition to other symptoms involving the cerebellum brain stem mid-brain
      hypothalamus and cerebral cortex and emotional changes including inappropriate
      euphoria and compulsive laughter or depression and apprehension. The last reported
      patient died in 2005 with an incubation period extending over four decades.
