  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired human prion disease characterized by rapidly progressive
      fatal neurodegeneration caused by the consumption of prion-containing tissue
      in endocannibalistic funeral rituals in Papua New Guinea until the late 1950s.
      After a decades-long asymptomatic period and a non-specific prodromal phase
      with headaches and arthralgia the most prominent neurological feature is ataxia
      in addition to other symptoms involving the cerebellum brain stem mid-brain
      hypothalamus and cerebral cortex and emotional changes including inappropriate
      euphoria and compulsive laughter or depression and apprehension. There have
      been no further description in the literature since 2004.
