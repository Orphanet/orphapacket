    Contents: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy due to POMK deficiency is a form of limb-girdle
      muscular dystrophy presenting in infancy with muscle weakness and delayed motor
      development (eventually learning to walk at 18 months of age) followed by progressive
      proximal weakness pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles mild facial weakness and
