  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic visceral malformation characterized by an abnormal
      continuous or discontinuous attachment of the spleen to the gonad epididymis
      or vas. Continuous type has a direct connection between spleen and the gonad
      whereas discontinuous type indicates gonadal tissue fused with an accessory
      spleen or ectopic spleen tissue without connection to the principal spleen.
      Males typically present with a scrotal mass or as an incidental finding during
      the management of cryptorchidism testicular tumors or inguinal hernia. In females
      this is usually an incidental finding during laparotomy.
