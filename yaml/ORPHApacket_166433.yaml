  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare reflex epilepsy characterized by reading-induced seizures which
      in most cases present with orofacial/jaw myoclonus possibly extending to the
      upper limbs but can also manifest as dyslexia or alexia and visual symptoms.
      In both variants secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures may evolve if the
      stimulus is not interrupted. The disease typically begins in the second or third
      decade of life and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. It usually
      takes a benign course with little tendency to spontaneous seizures.
