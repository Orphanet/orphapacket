  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP-1b) is a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism
      (PHP; see this term) characterized by localized resistance to parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) mainly in the renal tissues which manifests with hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia
      and elevated PTH levels. About 60-70% of patients also present with elevated
      TSH levels due to TSH resistance.
