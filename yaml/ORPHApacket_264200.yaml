  TextSection:
    Contents: 14q22q23 microdeletion syndrome is a rare partial deletion of the long
      arm of chromosome 14 characterized by ocular anomalies (anopthalmia/microphthalmia
      ptosis hypertelorism exophthalmos) pituitary anomalies (pituitary hypoplasia/aplasia
      with growth hormone deficiency and growth retardation) and hand/foot anomalies
      (polydactyly short digits pes cavus). Other clinical features may include muscular
      hypotonia psychomotor development delay/intellectual disability dysmorphic signs
      (facial asymmetry microretrognathia high-arched palate ear anomalies) congenital
      genitourinary malformations hearing impairment. Smaller 14q22 deletions may
      have variable expression.
