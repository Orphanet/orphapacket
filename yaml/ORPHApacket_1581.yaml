  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-distal monosomy 10q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 with a highly variable
      phenotype principally characterized by developmental delays (usually of language
      and speech) variable cognitive impairment and neurobehavioral abnormalities
      such as autism spectrum disorders and attention deficit disorder. Macrocephaly
      and mild dysmorphic features may by associated. Overlap with other syndromes
      such as Cowden syndrome Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and juvenile polyposis
      syndrome has been reported.
