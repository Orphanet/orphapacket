  TextSection:
    Contents: An infectious disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS)
      involvement caused by the TBE virus (TBEV) and transmitted to humans principally
      by the bite of ticks from the <i>Ixodes</i> genus. The symptomatology is often
      biphasic with the initial phase being associated with a nonspecific febrile
      illness and the second phase with meningitis meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis.
