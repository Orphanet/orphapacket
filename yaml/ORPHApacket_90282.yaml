  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypertrophic or verrucous lupus erythematosus is a rare type of chronic
      cutaneous lupus erythematosus characterized by the appearance of lesions on
      sun-exposed areas (frequently the extensor surfaces of forearms face upper trunk)
      which vary from squamous violet painful papules and blackish hyperkeratotic
      ulcers to depigmented atrophic plaques on the back hyperkeratotic papules on
      upper extremities and disseminated keratoacanthoma-like papulonodular verrucous
      lesions. Classic discoid lesions and squamous cell carcinoma may be associated.
      Histopathology reveals follicular plugging liquefactive basal layer degeneration
      and a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.
