  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare oblique facial cleft characterized by a congenital unilateral
      or bilateral defect beginning in the upper lip medial to the oral commissure
      and extending across the cheek as a groove ending between the middle and lateral
      third of the lower eyelid (resulting in coloboma). Bone involvement includes
      an alveolar cleft in the premolar region extending across the maxilla lateral
      to the infraorbital nerve and up to the infraorbital rim and orbital floor.
      The malformation may be associated with Tessier number 3 and number 4 clefts
      macrostomia or anophthalmos.
