    Contents: A rare acquired peripheral neuropathy characterized by paresis of the
      supraspinatus infraspinatus deltoid and biceps muscles (in C5-C6 injury) wrist
      and finger extensor muscles (C7 injury) or impaired hand function (C8-Th1 injury)
      on the affected side due to a traction lesion of the brachial plexus during
      delivery. The upper trunk of the brachial plexus is most commonly affected while
      isolated injury to the lower trunk is very rare. Potential sequelae of brachial
      plexus injury are muscle atrophy pain sensory deficits and secondary deformities.
