  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of holoprosencephaly characterized by midline fusion
      limited to the septal and/or preoptic regions of the telencephalon without a
      significant frontal neocortical fusion. Midline craniofacial malformations are
      generally mild and include solitary median maxillary incisor and pyriform sinus
      stenosis. Other reported manifestations include language delay learning difficulties
      and behavioral disorders. Imaging reveals abnormal fornix absent or hypoplasic
      anterior corpus callosum and unpaired anterior cerebral artery.
