  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized
      by genitourinary malformations (hydrometrocolpos in females and in males glanular
      hypospadias and prominent scrotal raphe)  postaxial polydactyly that may affect
      only one or several limbs and to a lesser extent cardiac defects. Hydrometrocolpos
      is due to either a congenital obstruction imperforate hymen or vaginal atressia
      and causes a palpable mass and possibly hydronephrosis. Other anomalies occasionally
      reported include choanal atresia pituitary dysplasia esophageal atresia and
      distal tracheoesophageal fistula Hirschsprung disease vertebral anomalies and
      hydrops fetalis. The disorder is allelic with Bardet-Biedl and as some phenotypic
      overlap has been observed patients should be reevaluated in later childhood
      for retinistis pigmentosas and other signs of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.
