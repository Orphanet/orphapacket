  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by childhood
      onset of slowly progressive motor and cognitive regression resulting in intellectual
      disability and loss of language and ambulation associated with the appearance
      of dystonia parkinsonism chorea or rigidity. Ataxia dysarthria and seizures
      have also been reported. Head circumference percentiles may decline over time.
      Brain imaging shows progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy in some patients
      also thinning of the corpus callosum.
