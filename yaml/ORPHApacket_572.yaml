  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by
      absence of HLA class II molecules on the surface of immune cells leading to
      severely impaired cellular and humoral immune response to foreign antigens severe
      CD4+ T-cell lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. The disease clinically manifests
      with early onset of severe and recurrent infections mainly of the respiratory
      and gastrointestinal tract protracted diarrhea with failure to thrive and autoimmune
      disease and is frequently fatal in childhood.
