  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal myopathy Tateyama type is a rare genetic slowly progressive distal
      myopathy disorder characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness limited to the
      small muscles of the hands and feet (in particular thenar and hypothenar muscle
      atrophy) increased serum creatine kinase and severely reduced caveolin-3 expression
      on muscle biopsy. Some patients may also show calf hypertrophy pes cavus and
      signs of muscle hyperexcitability.
