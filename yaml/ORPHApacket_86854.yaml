  TextSection:
    Contents: Splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a rare indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma characterized by abnormal clonal proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes
      with involvement in the spleen bone marrow and frequently the blood. It usually
      presents with splenomegaly lymphocytosis anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Hepatitis
      C virus and autoimmune manifestations such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia and
      autoimmune thrombocytopenia could be associated.
