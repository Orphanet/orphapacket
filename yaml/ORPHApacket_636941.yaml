  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized by connective tissue
      defects (joint laxity of finger joints and knees small joint hypermotility and
      tissue fragility) vascular complications (atrioventricular defect symptomatic
      cerebral aneurysm vascular dissection) and frontoparietally-accentuated polymicrogyria
      of the cobblestone variant. Specific brain anomalies (including cerebrocortical
      dysplasia cerebellar microcysts and white matter anomalies) are present in all
      patients. Most of the affected individuals have developmental delay and may
      develop epilepsy. Additional clinical features include spontaneous intracranial
      hypotension idiopathic intracranial hypertension headache chronic pain syndrome
      peripheral neuropathy plexopathy translucent skin and clubfoot. Dysmorphic features
      such as eye anomalies (strabismus bilateral hyperopia esotropia proptosis) pinched
      nose thin upper lip crowded teeth and retrognathia are also reported.
