    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by sclerosing dysplasia affecting
      the diaphyseal and metaphyseal regions of the long bones as well as the skull
      and metacarpals in association with skin changes like those seen in ichthyosis

      Patients present in adulthood primarily with swelling of the extremities and
      occasional mild pain in the legs.
