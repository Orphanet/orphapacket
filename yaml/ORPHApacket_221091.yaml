  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired peripheral neuropathy characterized by paroxysmal sharp
      stabbing electric-shock-like orofacial pain that is restricted to one or more
      of the trigeminal nerve divisions and mostly unilateral. Attacks are brief (few
      seconds to a maximum of two minutes) but typically occur repeatedly and periodically
      can arise spontaneously or be triggered by innocuous stimuli and are frequently
      accompanied by tic-like cramps of facial muscles. The condition affects women
      more often than men.
