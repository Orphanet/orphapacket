  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital myopathy characterized by generalized proximal and
      distal muscle weakness and/or atrophy with slow progression. A subset of patients
      present with scapuloperoneal weakness and scapular winging. Disease onset usually
      occurs during infancy/childhood but adult-onset cases have also been reported.
      Patients may have respiratory problems and/or cardiomyopathy. Muscle biopsies
      show hyaline body inclusions in type I fibers.
