    Contents: Severe achondroplasia-developmental delay-acanthosis nigricans syndrome
      is characterised by the association of severe achondroplasia with developmental
      delay and acanthosis nigricans. It has been described in four unrelated individuals.
      Structural central nervous system anomalies seizures and hearing loss were also
      reported together with bowing of the clavicle femur tibia and fibula in some
      cases. The syndrome is caused by a Lys650Met substitution in the kinase domain
      of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (encoded by the <i>FGFR3</i> gene; 4p16.3).
