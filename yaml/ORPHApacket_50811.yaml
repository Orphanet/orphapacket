  TextSection:
    Contents: Lipodystrophy-intellectual disability-deafness syndrome is an extremely
      rare form of genetic lipodystrophy (see this term) reported in 3 patients from
      one family to date characterized by generalized congenital lipodystrophy low
      birth weight progressive sensorineural deafness occurring in childhood intellectual
      deficit progressive osteopenia delayed skeletal maturation skeletal abnormalities
      described as slender undermineralized tubular bones and dense metaphyseal striations
      in the distal femur ulna and radius of older patients. Autosomal recessive inheritance
      has been suggested.
