  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare respiratory disease characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary
      infections and bronchiectasis predominantly in the lower lung fields as well
      as azoospermia with reduced fertility due to production of thick viscous mucus
      which causes mild airflow obstruction in the respiratory tract and obstruction
      of sperm transport in the genital tract. Patients commonly present in adulthood.
      Sweat gland and pancreatic function are normal. The cause of the syndrome is
      unknown however mercury exposure had been proposed as a potential cause.
