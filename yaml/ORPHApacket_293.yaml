  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital herpes virus infection is a group of anomalies that an infant
      may present as a result of maternal infection and subsequent foetal infection
      with herpes virus. This virus causes recurrent cutaneous infections in adults
      often involving the lips or the genitalia. Herpes infections in other organs
      such as the liver or central nervous system are less frequent.
