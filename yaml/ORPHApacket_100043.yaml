    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by intermediate
      motor median nerve conduction velocities (usually between 25 and 45 m/s) and
      signs of both demyelination and axonal degeneration in nerve biopsies. It presents
      with usual clinical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (progressive muscle
      weakness and atrophy of the distal extremities distal sensory loss reduced or
      absent deep tendon reflexes and feet deformities) in the first to second decade
      of life with steady progression until the fourth decade severe progression and
      stabilization afterwards.
