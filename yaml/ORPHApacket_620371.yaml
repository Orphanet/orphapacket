  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic renal tubular disease characterized by hypomagnesemia
      (due to renal magnesium wasting) hypokalemia and activation of renin production
      due to specific mitochondrial DNA mutations. Hypocalciuria metabolic alkalosis
      progressive chronic kidney disease as well as arterial hypertension and hypercholesterolemia
      have been reported. Tetany tremor paresthesia muscle fatigue chondrocalcinosis
      and cerebral seizures can be present. Extrarenal manifestations of mitochondrial
      dysfuntion may not be evident in the patients.
