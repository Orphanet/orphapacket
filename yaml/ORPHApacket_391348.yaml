  TextSection:
    Contents: Growth and developmental delay-hypotonia-vision impairment-lactic acidosis
      syndrome is a rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder
      characterized by intrauterine growth retardation microcephaly hypotonia vision
      impairment speech and language delay and lactic acidosis with reduced respiratory
      chain activity (typically complex I). Additonal features may include macrocytic
      anemia tremor muscular atrophy dysmetria and mild intellectual disability.
