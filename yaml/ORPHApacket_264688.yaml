  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital chylothorax is a rare potentially life-threatening neonatal
      condition characterized by the accumulation of chyle within the pleural space
      leading to respiratory distress malnutrition and immunological compromise either
      immediately after birth or within the first few weeks of life. Congenital chylothorax
      is the most common cause of pleural effusion in neonates; it can occur primarily
      due to developmental anomalies of the lymphatic duct or can be associated with
      chromosomal anomalies (e.g. Noonan syndrome Turner syndrome and Down syndrome)
      hydrops fetalis mediastinal neuroblastoma and other congenital malformations.
