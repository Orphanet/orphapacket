  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-cerebellar hypoplasia-cardiac conduction defect syndrome
      is a rare genetic congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by
      growth failure global developmental delay profound intellectual disability autistic
      behaviors acquired second-degree heart block with bradycardia and vasomotor
      instability. Hands and feet present with long fusiform fingers campto-clinodactyly
      and crowded toes while craniofacial dysmorphism includes microcephaly broad
      forehead thin eyebrows upslanting palpebral fissures large ears with prominent
      antihelix prominent nose long philtrum thin upper lip vermillion and prominent
      lower lip. Neurological signs include hypotonia brisk reflexes dystonic-like
      movements and truncal ataxia and imaging shows cerebellar hypoplasia and simplified
      gyral pattern.
