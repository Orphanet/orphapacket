  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency characterized
      by excessive accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes most notably in skeletal
      muscle leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness with walking disability
      and reduced respiratory function. The late-onset form includes all cases in
      which hypertrophic cardiomyopathy did not manifest or was not diagnosed at or
      under the age of 1 year as well as all cases with symptom onset above the age
      of 1 year.
