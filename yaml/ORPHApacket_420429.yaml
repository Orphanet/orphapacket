  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency
      characterized by excessive accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes most notably
      in skeletal muscle leading to slowly progressive muscle weakness with walking
      disability and reduced respiratory function. The late-onset form includes all
      cases in which hypertrophic cardiomyopathy did not manifest or was not diagnosed
      at or under the age of 1 year as well as all cases with symptom onset above
      the age of 1 year.
