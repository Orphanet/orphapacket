  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare punctate palmoplantar keratoderma characterized by multiple small
      round to oval or rhomboid yellowish hyperkeratotic papules and plaques most
      commonly localized to the palms of the hands and soles of the feet potentially
      extending to the dorsum of the hands and feet in severe cases. Histopathological
      analysis shows hyperkeratosis epidermal hypertrophy and fragmentation and rarefaction
      of elastic fibers. The condition can be sporadic or familial.
