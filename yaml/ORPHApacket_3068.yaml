    Contents: Intellectual disability-myopathy-short stature-endocrine defect syndrome
      is a rare congenital myopathy syndrome characterized by nonprogressive myopathy
      (manifesting with mild facial and generalized weakness bilateral ptosis and
      severe lumbar lordosis) severe intellectual disability short stature and sexual
