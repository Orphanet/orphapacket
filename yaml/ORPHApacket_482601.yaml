  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive distal myopathy characterized by slowly progressive
      diffuse muscle weakness in childhood followed by predominantly distal muscle
      weakness in adolescence and quadriceps muscle weakness in the fourth decade.
      Facial muscle weakness is commonly reported. Muscle biopsy shows fiber size
      variation increased internal nuclei fiber splitting rimmed vacuoles and focal
      endomysial fibrosis.
