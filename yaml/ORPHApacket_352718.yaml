    Contents: Progressive retinal dystrophy due to retinol transport defect is a rare
      genetic metabolite absorption and transport disorder characterized by progressive
      rod-cone dystrophy usually presenting with impaired night vision in childhood
      progressive loss of visual acuity and severe retinol deficiency without keratomalacia.
      Association with ocular colobomas severe acne and hypercholesterolemia has been
      reported.
