  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome with cardiac involvement
      as a major feature characterized by QT prolongation congenital heart defects
      syndactyly facial dysmorphism and neurodevelopmental features. There are three
      clinical phenotypes recognized the classical types that present with a prolonged
      QT interval and either with (TS1) or without (TS2) cutaneous syndactyly of fingers
      and toes. The atypical form (ATS) causes multi-system health concerns but not
      necessarily with prolonged QT.
