  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic intellectual disability characterized by intellectual
      deficit short stature obesity genital abnormalities and hand and/or toe contractures.
      The patients also present with generalized osteoporosis and a history of frequent
      fractures. This syndrome is similar to Prader-Willi syndrome but the hand contractures
      and osteoporosis together with the lack of hypotonia indicate this is a different
      entity.
