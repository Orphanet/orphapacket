  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary isolated aplastic anemia is a rare genetic constitutional
      aplastic anemia disorder characterized by severe peripheral blood pancytopenia
      and bone marrow hypoplasia in multiple individuals of a family in the absence
      of any somatic symptoms. Abnormal bleeding as well as erythrocyte macrocytosis
      is reported and patients usually become transfusion-dependent.
