  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome is a rare parkinsonian disorder
      characterized by unilateral body atrophy and slowly progressive ipsilateral
      hemiparkinsonian signs (bradykinesia rigidity and tremor). Patients typically
      present with unilateral action-induced dystonia in upper or lower limbs that
      progresses and becomes bilateral or with tremor which occurs predominantly at
      rest and progresses to hemiparkinsonism. Scoliosis scapular winging raised shoulders
      brisk reflexes and extensor plantar responses are frequently associated.
