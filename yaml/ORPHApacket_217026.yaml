  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-facio-cardio-skeletal syndrome Hadziselimovic type is a
      rare syndrome with cardiac malformations characterized by prenatal-onset growth
      retardation (low birth weight and short stature) hypotonia developmental delay
      and intellectual disability associated with microcephaly and craniofacial (low
      anterior hairline hypotelorism thick lips with carp-shaped mouth high-arched
      palate low-set ears) cardiac (conotruncal heart malformations such as tetralogy
      of Fallot) and skeletal (hypoplastic thumbs and first metacarpals) abnormalities.
