  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-facio-cardio-skeletal syndrome Hadziselimovic type is a
      rare syndrome with cardiac malformations (see this term) characterized by prenatal-onset
      growth retardation (low birth weight and short stature) hypotonia developmental
      delay and intellectual disability associated with microcephaly and craniofacial
      (low anterior hairline hypotelorism thick lips with carp-shaped mouth high-arched
      palate low-set ears) cardiac (conotruncal heart malformations such as tetralogy
      of Fallot; see these terms) and skeletal (hypoplastic thumbs and first metacarpals)
      abnormalities.
