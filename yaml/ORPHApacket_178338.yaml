    Contents: A rare photodermatosis characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity and
      slight dyspigmentation without an increased risk of developing skin tumors.
      Telangiectasia may also be observed but no other clinical abnormalities. Patients
      present in infancy or childhood mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.
