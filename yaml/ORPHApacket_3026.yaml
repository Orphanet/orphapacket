  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare nose and cavum anomaly characterized by variable defects of the
      radial ray concurrent choanal malformations and esotropia. Patients predominantly
      present with left radial ray hypoplasia however the spectrum of radial ray involvement
      may range from totally absent radius first metacarpal and phalangeal bones to
      hypoplastic carpal and metacarpal bones and a triphalangeal thumb. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1987.
