  TextSection:
    Contents: T-B- severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of rare monogenic
      primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a lack of functional peripheral
      T and B lymphocytes resulting in recurrent early-onset severe respiratory viral
      bacterial or fungal infections diarrhea and failure to thrive. Hypersensitivity
      to ionizing radiation is a characteristic feature of some of its sub-types.
