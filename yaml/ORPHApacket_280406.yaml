  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic coenzyme Q10 deficiency characterized by sensorineural
      deafness and severe progressive nephrotic syndrome not responding to steroid
      treatment. Clinical manifestations include early onset proteinuria hypoalbuminemia
      and edema leading to end-stage renal disease. The renal biopsy reveals focal
      segmental glomerulosclerosis and diffuse mesangial sclerosis. Rarely seizures
      ataxia and dysmorphic features have been described.
