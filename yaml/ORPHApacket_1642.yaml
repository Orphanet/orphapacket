    Contents: Distal monosomy 9p is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 with a highly variable
      phenotype typically characterized by intellectual disability craniofacial dysmorphism
      (trigonocephaly upslanting palpebral fissures hypoplastic supraorbital ridges)
      abnormal digits (long middle phalanges with short distal phalanges) as well
      as frequent association with genitourinary abnormalities (cryptorchidism hypospadias
      ambiguous genitalia 46,XY testicular dysgenesis). Congenital hypothyroidism
      and cardiovascular defects have been reported in some cases. Patients present
      an increased risk for gonadoblastoma.
