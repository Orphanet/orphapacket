    Contents: Lethal recessive chondrodysplasia is an extremely rare lethal form of
      chondrodysplasia characterized by severe micromelic dwarfism short and incurved
      limbs with normal hands and feet facial dysmorphism (disproportionately large
      skull frontal prominence slightly flattened nasal bridge and short neck) muscular
      hypotonia hyperlaxity of the extremities and a narrow thorax. Most patients
      die of respiratory distress during the first hours or weeks of life. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1988.
