  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumor arising from
      neuroendocrine chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (pheochromocytoma) or
      from any paraganglia from the skull base to the pelvic floor (paraganglioma).
      Clinical manifestations are often linked to excess catecholamines production
      causing sustained or paroxysmal elevations in blood pressure headache episodic
      profuse sweating palpitations pallor and apprehension or anxiety. Hereditary
      pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma tumors tend to present at younger ages to be
      multi-focal bilateral and recurrent or to have multiple synchronous neoplasms.
