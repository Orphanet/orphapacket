  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by congenital
      or early onset cataracts (usually bilateral) developmental delay progressive
      neurologic symptoms (including ataxia spasticity and sometimes seizures) and
      mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. Other major clinical features include
      truncal hypotonia dysarthia cerebellar signs (e.g: truncal titubation and intention
      tremor) and peripheral neuropathy (e.g: progressive weakness of the muscles
      in the lower limbs). Hypomyelination associated with periventricular white matter
      abnormalities is observed. Some patients may have mild lens opacity and cataracts
      could be absent.'
