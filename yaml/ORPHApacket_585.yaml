  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a very rare and fatal lysosomal
      storage disease characterized by a clinical phenotype that combines the features
      of different sulfatase deficiencies (whether lysosomal or not) that can have
      neonatal (most severe) infantile (most common) and juvenile (rare) presentations
      with manifestations including hypotonia coarse facial features mild deafness
      skeletal anomalies ichthyosis hepatomegaly developmental delay progressive neurologic
      deterioration and hydrocephalus.
