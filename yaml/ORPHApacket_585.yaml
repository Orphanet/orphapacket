  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lysosomal disease characterized by a clinical phenotype that
      combines the features of different sulfatase deficiencies (whether lysosomal
      or not). Clinical manifestations can include developmental delay progressive
      neurologic deterioration hydrocephalus hypotonia coarse facial features retinopathy
      skeletal anomalies hepatomegaly and ichthyosis to a variable degree. Multiple
      sulfatase deficiency (MSD) comprises severe to attenuated forms historically
      classified as neonatal (most severe form) infantile (most common form) or juvenile
      (rarest form).
