  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial aortic dissection is the term used to describe rupture of the
      aortic wall at the level of the media resulting in the formation of a false
      channel and deviation of part of the aortic flux. Familial predisposition to
      thoracic aortic aneurysms and type A dissections (concerning the ascending aorta
      and/or the aortic arch) has been demonstrated in around 19% of patients presenting
      with thoracic aortic dissections and several loci have been identified so far
      (16p12.2-p13.13 3p24-25). This predisposition is transmitted in an autosomal
      dominant manner.
