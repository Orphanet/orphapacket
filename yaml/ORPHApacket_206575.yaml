    Contents: Rippling muscle disease with myasthenia gravis is a rare acquired neuromuscular
      disease characterized by <i>CAV3</i> mutation-negative rippling muscle disease
      in association with acetylcholine receptor antibody-mediated myasthenia gravis.

      with myalgia in combination with generalized myasthenia gravis symptoms (ptosis
