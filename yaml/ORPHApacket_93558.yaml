    Contents: A rare non-amyloid monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease characterized
      by deposition of abnormal immunoglobulin light chains in the kidneys resulting
      in nephrotic syndrome and renal failure. Symptomatic extrarenal deposition is
      uncommon although hepatic cardiac and neural deposits have been reported. The
      condition frequently occurs in association with multiple myeloma or in patients
      with M protein and marrow plasma cells at monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined
      significance levels.
