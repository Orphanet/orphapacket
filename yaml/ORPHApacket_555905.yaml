  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autoimmune bullous skin disease characterized by painful and
      pruritic vesiculopustular eruptions resulting from circulating IgA antibodies
      against keratinocyte cell surface components. The lesions are typically found
      at the periphery of erythematous annular plaques and favor intertriginous regions.
      Histologically and immunologically IgA pemphigus can be subdivided into subcorneal
      pustular dermatosis and intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis.
