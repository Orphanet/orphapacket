  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a highly variable clinical phenotype including a benign infantile mitochondrial
      type affecting mainly the skeletal muscle a lethal infantile mitochondrial myopathy
      linked to severe metabolic acidosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal
      muscle and often also in heart Leigh syndrome which causes severe early-onset
      progressive and fatal encephalopathy and French-Canadian type Leigh syndrome
      which affects mostly the skeletal muscle but also brain and liver.
