  TextSection:
    Contents: Bilateral striopallidodentate calcinosis (BSPDC also erroneously called
      Fahr disease) is characterized by the accumulation of calcium deposits in different
      brain regions particularly the basal ganglia and dentate nucleus and is often
      associated with neurodegeneration.
