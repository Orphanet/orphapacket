  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital tracheomalacia is a rare condition where the trachea is soft
      and flexible causing the tracheal wall to collapse when exhaling coughing or
      crying that usually presents in infancy and that is characterized by stridor
      and noisy breathing or upper respiratory infections. Tracheomalacia improves
      by the age of 18-24 months.
