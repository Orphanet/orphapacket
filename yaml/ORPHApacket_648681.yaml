  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare scleritis characterized by severe ocular inflammation of sclera
      associated with an underlying systemic inflammatory condition most often rheumatoid
      arthritis granulomatosis with polyangiitis but also seronegative spondyloarthropathies
      vasculitides and systemic lupus erythematosus. Ocular presentation is a tender
      or painful violet-blueish eye with injection of deep scleral vessels. It can
      be unilateral or bilateral. Immune-mediated scleritis is more often granulomatous
      and/or necrotizing. Systemic clinical signs depend on the underlying disease.
