    Contents: An extremely rare multiple congenital malformation syndrome characterized
      by the association of ablepharon macrostomia abnormal external ears syndactyly
      of the hands and feet skin findings (such as dry and coarse skin or redundant
      folds of skin) absent or sparse hair genital malformations and developmental
      delay (in 2/3 of cases). Other reported manifestations include malar hypoplasia
      absent or hypoplastic nipples umbilical abnormalities and growth retardation.
      It is a mainly sporadic disorder although a few familial cases having been reported
      and it displays significant clinical overlap with Fraser syndrome.
