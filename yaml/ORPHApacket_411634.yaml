  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of cystinosis characterized by an accumulation of cystine
      in different organs and tissues particularly in the kidneys and eyes and that
      clinically manifests between childhood and adolescence with a slowly progressive
      proximal tubulopathy and/or proteinuria and photophobia. Extra-renal manifestations
      (e.g. hypothyroidism insulin-dependent diabetes hepatosplenomegaly muscular
      and cerebral involvement) are less severe than in the infantile form of the
      disease.
