    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by variable developmental delay intellectual disability early-onset seizures
      and facial dysmorphism (including arched eyebrows long palpebral fissures prominent
      nasal bridge large ears thin upper lip and high arched palate). Other reported
      features are microcephaly hypotonia growth retardation congenital heart defects
      and malformations of the fingers and toes as well as additional neurologic manifestations
      (such as ataxia or spastic quadriplegia). Brain imaging may show hypoplastic
      corpus callosum white matter abnormalities or cortical atrophy.
