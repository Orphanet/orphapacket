    Contents: A rare lung disorder that is mainly associated with chronic allograft
      dysfunction after lung transplantation and that is characterized by inflammation
      and fibrosis of bronchiolar walls that reduce the diameter of the bronchioles
      and result in progressive and irreversible airflow obstruction.
