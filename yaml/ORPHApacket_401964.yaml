  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized
      by distal muscle weakness and atrophy (principally of peroneal muscles) associated
      with distal sensory loss (tactile vibration) pes cavus present since infancy
      or childhood and axonal swelling with neurofilament accumulation on nerve biopsy.
      Other features may include hand muscle involvement hypo/arreflexia gait disturbances
      muscle cramps toe abnormalities and mild cardiomyopathy.
