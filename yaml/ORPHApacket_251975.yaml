    Contents: Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor is a rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor
      characterized by the presence of uniform rosette- (or pseudorosette-) forming
      neurocytes with an astrocytic component together creating a biphasic pattern.
      It can present with signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache vomiting
      papilledema) hydrocephalus seizures ataxia and visual disturbances or can be
      diagnosed incidentally in asymptomatic patients. The tumor usually arises in
      the midline involving the fourth ventricle or the cerebellum.
