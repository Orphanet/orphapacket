    Contents: A rare fast-flow vascular malformation characterized by direct connections
      between extracranial arteries and veins bypassing the capillary bed due to abnormal
      vasculogenesis or angiogenesis. These fast-flow vascular lesions comprise numerous
      vessels which may be tortuous and dysfunctional resulting in red discoloration
      pain ulceration bleeding and severe deformities. They are primarily found in
      the head and neck region followed by the limbs and trunk.
