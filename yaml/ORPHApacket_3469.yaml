  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic type of cerebral malformation characterized by aprosencephaly
      (absence of telencephalon and diencephalon) oculo-facial anomalies (i.e. ocular
      hypotelorism or cyclopia malformation/absence of nasal structures cleft lip)
      preaxial limb defects (i.e. hypoplastic hands absent halluces) and various other
      anomalies including ambiguous genitalia imperforate anus and vertebral anomalies.
      The syndrome is thought to have an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.
