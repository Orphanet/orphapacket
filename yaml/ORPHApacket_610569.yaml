  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by severe brain malformations associated with cerebral parenchymal underdevelopment
      arthrogryposis and club feet due to mutations in <i>KIAA1109</i> gene. Majority
      of the cases are early lethal. Milder cases may present with severe global developmental
      delay intellectual disability microcephaly hydrocephaly heart defects renal
      problems severe muscle hypotonia causing incapacity to stand without a support,epilepsy
      syndactlyly and variable dysmorphic facial features (including hypotelorism
      hypertelorism small eyes low-set and posteriorly rotated ears short nose flattened
      nasal bridge anteverted nares retrognathia).
