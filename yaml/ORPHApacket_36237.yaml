  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired typically benign bacterial infectious disease caused
      by <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> characterized by large fragile vesicles and
      flaccid bullae on an erythematous base which evolve into moistened erosions
      with a thin varnish-like crust usually localized in intertriginous areas of
      the trunk and extremities (armpits groins between the fingers or toes beneath
      the breasts). Although uncommon systemic symptoms such as fever diarrhea and
      weakness may be associated.
