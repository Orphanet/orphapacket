  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia disorder characterized by increased blast
      cells (myeloblasts monoblast and/or promonoblasts) representing more than 20%
      of the total bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood differential counts with 20-80%
      of BM cells being of monocytic lineage. Clinical presentation is the result
      of bone marrow involvement and extramedullary infiltration by the leukemic cells
      and includes asthenia pallor fever dizziness respiratory symptoms easy bruising
      bleeding disorders and neurological deficits. Gingival hyperplasia organomegaly
      especially hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy may also be associated.
