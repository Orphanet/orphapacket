    Contents: A rare genetic intestinal disease characterized by persistent potentially
      life-threatening watery diarrhea with excessive levels of chloride in stools
      hypochloremia hyponatremia hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis resulting in
      chronic dehydration and failure to thrive. Antenatal ultrasound typically reveals
      polyhydramnios and significant dilatation of the fetal intestinal loops.
