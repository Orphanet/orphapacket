  TextSection:
    Contents: Ganglioneuroma is a rare tumor of neuroepithelial tissue a benign and
      well-differentiated tumor of neural crest origin arising from the sympathetic
      nervous system and composed of ganglion cells and stromal Schwann cells. It
      can arise anywhere from the base of the skull to the pelvis with the most frequent
      locations being the adrenal glands retroperitoneum posterior mediastinum and
      the pelvis or in rare cases the central nervous system heart bones intestine
      or other sites. It may be asymptomatic or present with various symptoms due
      to mass effect. Association with neurofibromatosis type I multiple endocrine
      neoplasia type 2B and Turner syndrome was reported.
