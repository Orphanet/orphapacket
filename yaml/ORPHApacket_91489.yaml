    Contents: Isolated congenital megalocornea is a genetic non-syndromic developmental
      defect of the anterior eye segment characterized by bilateral enlargement of
      the corneal diameter (>12.5 mm) and a deep anterior eye chamber without an elevation
      in intraocular pressure. It can manifest with mild to moderate myopia as well
      as photophobia and iridodonesis (due to iris hypoplasia). Associated complications
      include lens dislocation retinal detachment presenile cataract development and
      secondary glaucoma.
