  TextSection:
    Contents: Spastic ataxia with congenital miosis is a rare hereditary ataxia characterized
      by an apparently non-progressive or slowly progressive symmetrical ataxia of
      gait pyramidal signs in the limbs spasticity and hyperreflexia (especially in
      the lower limbs) together with dysarthria and impaired pupillary reaction to
      light presenting as a fixed miosis (with pupils that seldom exceed 2 mm in diameter
      and dilate poorly with mydriatics). Nystagmus may also be present.
