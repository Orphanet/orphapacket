    Contents: A rare purine metabolism disorder due to inherited deficiency of the
      xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase enzyme and is characterized by very low (or undetectable)
      concentrations of uric acid in blood and urine and very high concentration of
      xanthine in urine leading to urolithiasis.
