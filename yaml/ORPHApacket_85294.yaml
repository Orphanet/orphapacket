  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked epilepsy-learning disabilities-behavior disorders syndrome
      is characterized by epilepsy learning difficulties macrocephaly and aggressive
      behaviour. It has been described in males from a four-generation kindred. It
      is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait and is likely to be caused by
      mutations in the gene encoding synapsin I (Xp11.3-q12).
