  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation
      of myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring rearrangements in the PDGFRB
      gene in the blood bone marrow and often other tissues as well (spleen lymph
      nodes skin etc.). It usually presents as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia with
      eosinophilia chronic eosinophilic leukemia atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia
      juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia
      or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients usually present with anemia leukocytosis
      monocytosis eosinophilia and/or splenomegaly or systemic symptoms such as fever
      sweating and/or weight loss.
