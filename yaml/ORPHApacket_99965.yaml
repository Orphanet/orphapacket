  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired motor neuron disease characterized by an initial unilateral
      weakness in the intrinsic hand muscles that eventually spreads to the opposite
      limb (with an asymmetrical distribution) and that has a very slow progression
      of muscular atrophy over a 20 year period.
