  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngologic disease characterized by total or partial
      anosmia at birth. The anosmia is caused by a defect in the development of the
      olfactory bulbs or by replacement of the olfactory epithelium by respiratory
      epithelium. Isolated congenital anosmia is found in some parents of individuals
      with Kallman syndrome.
