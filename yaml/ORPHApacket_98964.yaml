  TextSection:
    Contents: Type I lattice corneal dystrophy (LCDI) is a frequent form of stromal
      corneal dystrophy (see this term) characterized by a network of delicate interdigitating
      branching filamentous opacities within the cornea with progressive visual impairment
      and no systemic manifestations.
