  TextSection:
    Contents: Otopalatodigital syndrome spectrum disorder is a primary bone dysplasia
      and encompasses a group of congenital anomalies that are characterized by skeletal
      dysplasia of varying clinical severity and an X linked dominant pattern of inheritance.
      This group includes otopalatodigital syndrome type 1 and 2 (OPD1 OPD2) which
      are characterized in affected males by cleft palate conductive hearing loss
      craniofacial abnormalities and skeletal dysplasia; Melnick-Needles syndrome
      (MNS) which displays skeletal deformities in females and embryonic or perinatal
      lethality in most males; frontometaphyseal dysplasia (FMD); and terminal osseous
      dysplasia - pigmentary defects.
