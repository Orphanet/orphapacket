  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability-craniofacial dysmorphism-cryptorchidism syndrome
      is a rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability syndrome characterized by
      mild to moderate intellectual disability developmental delay (with speech and
      language development more severely affected) and facial dysmorphism which typically
      includes full arched eyebrows hypertelorism down-slanting palpebral fissures
      long eyelashes ptosis low-set simple ears bulbous nasal tip flat philtrum wide
      mouth with downturned corners and thin upper lip and diastema of the teeth.
      Association with infantile hypotonia seizures cryptorchidism in males and congenital
      abnormalities including cardiac cerebral or ocular defects may be observed.
