  TextSection:
    Contents: An extremely rare disorder of methionine cycle and sulfur amino acid
      metabolism characterized by increased urine excretion of beta-mercaptolactate-cysteine
      disulfide (due to deficiency of mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity
      in erythrocytes) leading to a positive cyanide nitroprusside test. Association
      with intellectual disability congenital lens dislocation and behavioral abnormalities
      has been reported however the causal link remains to be established. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1981.
