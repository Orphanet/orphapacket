    Contents: A rare life-threatening mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome disease
      characterized by severe progressive sensorimotor neuropathy associated with
      corneal ulceration scarring or anesthesia acral mutilation metabolic and immunologic
      derangement and hepatopathy (which can manifest with fulminant hepatic failure
      a Reye-like syndrome or indolent progression to liver cirrhosis depending on
      clinical form involved) present in the Navajo Native American population. Clinical
      presentation includes failure to thrive distal limb weakness with reduced sensation
      limb contractures with loss of function areflexia recurrent metabolic acidosis
      with intercurrent illness immunologic anomalies manifesting with severe systemic
      infections and sexual infantilism.
