  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by congenital absence of the right
      or left pulmonary artery usually ending within 2 cm of its expected origin from
      the pulmonary trunk. Patients often also have other cardiovascular abnormalities
      and respective symptoms and are then typically diagnosed in infancy or childhood
      while isolated cases generally present with a mild clinical course and may go
      undiagnosed until adulthood. Presenting clinical features in isolated cases
      include hemoptysis exertional dyspnea and recurrent respiratory infections.
      The condition is typically accompanied by marked changes of lung tissue and
      may if unrecognized result in massive hemoptysis and pulmonary hypertension.
