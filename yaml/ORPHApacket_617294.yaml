  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder related to monochorionic twin pregnancy characterized
      by unbalanced inter-twin blood transfusion with subsequent anemia in the donor
      and polycythemia in the recipient twin. Amniotic fluid abnormalities are absent.
      Doppler measurement of middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocities reveals
      significantly discordant velocities. The condition can occur spontaneously or
      complicate incomplete fetoscopic laser surgery.
