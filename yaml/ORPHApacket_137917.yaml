  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare usually sporadic congenital anomaly that is more commonly seen
      in females than in males (2:1) where the nose is blocked by bony or soft tissue
      formed during embryologic development on only one side (more commonly on the
      right side) and which is characterized by nasal obstruction and rhinorrhea usually
      presenting at birth but that may go undetected until a respiratory infection
      aggravates the condition.
