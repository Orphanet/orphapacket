  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mycosis characterized by granulomatous inflammation primarily
      of the lung after inhalation of spores of <i>Histoplasma capsulatum</i>. The
      severity of clinical disease depends on the immune status of the individual
      and the size of the inoculum. In immunocompetent persons the infection usually
      takes a self-limiting and asymptomatic or relatively mild flu-like course. In
      immunocompromised patients it can become progressive and disseminated involving
      multiple organs and presenting with fever pneumonia hepatosplenomegaly skin
      infiltrates and endocarditis among others.
