  TextSection:
    Contents: Bilateral acute depigmentation of the iris (BADI) is characterized by
      acute onset of bilateral iris depigmentation pigment dispersion in the anterior
      chamber and heavy pigment deposition in the anterior chamber angle. Patients
      typically present with acute and usually severe photophobia blurred vision red
      eye and ocular discomfort or pain with a usually self-limiting clinical course.
      Cases often occur after a flu-like illness upper respiratory tract infection
      and after the use of oral moxifloxacin. When associated with iris epithelial
      depigmentation iris transillumination defects and atonic/mydriatic pupil the
      condition is referred to as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT) which
      has an increased risk of severe intractable rise in intraocular pressure.
