  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skeletal disorder characterized clinically by multiple fractures
      wormian bones of the skull dentinogenesis imperfecta and facial dysmorphism
      (hypertelorism periorbital fullness). Although the signs are very similar to
      osteogenesis imperfecta characteristic cortical defects in the absence of osteopenia
      and collagen abnormalities are considered to be distinctive. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1999.
