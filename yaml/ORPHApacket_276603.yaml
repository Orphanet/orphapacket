  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital isolated hyperinsulinism disorder characterized by
      diazoxide unresponsive recurrent episodes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting
      from an excessive insulin secretion by the pancreatic bêta-cells due to Kir6.2
      deficiency. Hypoglycemia may lead to variable clinical manifestation ranging
      from asymptomatic hypoglycemia revealed by routine blood glucose monitoring
      to macrosomia at birth mild to moderate hepatomegaly and life-threatening hypoglycemic
      coma or status epilepticus further leading to poor neurological outcome.
