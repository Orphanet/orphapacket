    Contents: A rare severe disorder of urea cycle metabolism typically characterized
      by either a neonatal-onset of severe hyperammonemia that occurs few days after
      birth and manifests with lethargy vomiting hypothermia seizures coma and death
      or a presentation outside the newborn period at any age with (sometimes) milder
      symptoms of hyperammonemia.
