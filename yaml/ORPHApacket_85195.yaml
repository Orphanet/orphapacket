    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by abnormal bone metabolism
      with bone pain deformity pathological fractures early conductive hearing loss
      and dental abnormalities. Focal bone lesions are typically found in the appendicular
      skeleton and consist of progressively expanding lytic areas while generalized
      disordered bone modeling and altered trabecular pattern are the result of the
      multifocal progressive nature of the disease. Age of onset is variable mode
      of inheritance is autosomal dominant.
