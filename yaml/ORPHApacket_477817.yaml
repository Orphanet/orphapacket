  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 17 characterized
      by a combination of features of 17p11.2 microduplication syndrome and Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease type 1A. Patients present with infantile onset of global developmental
      delay hypotonia feeding difficulties and failure to thrive as well as childhood
      onset of peripheral neuropathy with distal extremity weakness or atrophy gait
      impairment sensory loss reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles
      and foot deformities. Facial dysmorphism cardiac and renal anomalies and syringomyelia
      may also be observed.
