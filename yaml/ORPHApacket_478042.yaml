  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by neonatal onset of hypotonia feeding difficulties deafness and early fatal
      respiratory failure. Cardiac and liver involvement has been reported. Serum
      lactate is increased and metabolic studies show decreased activity of mitochondrial
      respiratory complexes I and IV in skeletal muscle.
