  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by a usually congenital and
      unilateral round or oval gray white or yellowish depression in the optic disc.
      There may be more than one pit present in one eye and the anomaly is most commonly
      found in the inferotemporal region of the optic disc although any sector may
      be involved. Patients are often asymptomatic or may present with visual field
      defects in particular paracentral arcuate scotoma connected to an enlarged blind
      spot. A number of patients develop serous macular detachment with loss of vision
      typically becoming apparent in the third or fourth decade of life.
