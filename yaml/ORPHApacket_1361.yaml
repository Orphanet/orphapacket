  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by low serum carnosinase
      activity persistent carnosinuria and carnosinemia. The clinical phenotype is
      highly variable with some patients remaining asymptomatic while others have
      been reported to show severe developmental delay intellectual disability hypotonia
      seizures and other neurological signs and symptoms.
