  TextSection:
    Contents: Twin twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) is a rare condition seen in twin
      monochorionic pregnancies typically developing during the 15-26 week gestation
      period and usually due to unbalanced intertwin placental anastomoses where an
      unequal exchange of blood between twins causes oligohydramnios in one sac and
      polyhydramnios in the other which can lead to a high perinatal mortality rate
      and a high rate of disability in survivors if left untreated
