    Contents: A rare idiopathic nephrotic syndrome characterized by pediatric onset
      of proteinuria hypoalbuminemia and edema. Patients respond successfully to the
      initial standard course of corticosteroids but are resistant to standard therapy
      for a subsequent relapse and following this relapse remain steroid-resistant.
