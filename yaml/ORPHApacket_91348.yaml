  TextSection:
    Contents: Functioning gonadotropic adenoma is a very rare pituitary tumor macroscopically
      characterized by a soft well vascularized variable sized adenoma with occasional
      areas of hemorrage or necrosis that secretes biologically active gonadotropins.
      In addition to common neurological signs due to mass effect (headache and/or
      visual field deterioration) additional clinical manifestations include menstrual
      irregularities (secondary amenorrhea oligomenorhea or severe menorrhagia) galactorrhea
      infertility or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (in premenopausal women) testicular
      enlargement and occasionally hypogonadism (in men) and isosexual precocious
      puberty (in children).
