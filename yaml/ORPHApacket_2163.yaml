  TextSection:
    Contents: Holoprosencephaly-craniosynostosis syndrome is a rare developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by the association of primary
      craniosynostosis (usually involving the coronal and metopic sutures) with holoprosencephaly
      (ranging from alobar to most commonly semilobar) and various skeletal anomalies
      (typically hand and feet anomalies including fifth digit clinodactyly hypoplastic
      phalanges and cone-shaped epiphyses small vertebral bodies scoliosis coxa valga
      and/or flexion deformities of hips). Craniofacial asymmetry microcephaly brachy/plagiocephaly
      short stature and psychomotor delay are additional common features.
