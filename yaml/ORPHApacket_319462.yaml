  TextSection:
    Contents: Inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome due to biallelic BRCA2 mutations
      is a rare cancer-predisposing syndrome associated with the D1 subgroup of Fanconi
      anemia (FA) characterized by progressive bone marrow failure cardiac brain intestinal
      or skeletal abnormalities and predisposition to various malignancies. Bone marrow
      suppression and the incidence of developmental abnormalities are less frequent
      than in other FA but cancer risk is very high with the spectrum of childhood
      cancers including Wilms tumor brain tumor (often medulloblastoma) and ALL/AML.
