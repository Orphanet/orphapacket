  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunodeficiency due to a classical component pathway complement deficiency
      is a primary immunodeficiency due to a deficiency in either complement components
      C1q C1r C1s C2 or C4 characterized by increased susceptibility to bacterial
      infections particularly with encapsulated bacteria and increased risk for autoimmune
      disease. Most commonly these include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) SLE-like
      disease Henoch-Schonlein purpura polymyositis and arthralgia. Disease severity
      is variable and dependent on the complement affected.
