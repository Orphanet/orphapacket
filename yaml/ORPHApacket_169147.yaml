    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency due to a deficiency in either complement
      components C1q C1r C1s C2 or C4 characterized by increased susceptibility to
      bacterial infections particularly with encapsulated bacteria and increased risk
      for autoimmune disease. Most commonly these include systemic lupus erythematosus
      (SLE) SLE-like disease Henoch-Schonlein purpura polymyositis and arthralgia.
      Disease severity is variable and dependent on the complement affected.
