  TextSection:
    Contents: Striate palmoplantar keratoderma is an isolated focal hereditary palmoplantar
      keratoderma characterized by linear hyperkeratosis along the flexor aspect of
      the fingers and on palms as well as focal hyperkeratosis of the plantar skin.
      Patients present with painful thickening of the skin on palms and soles with
      occasional fissuring blistering and hyperhidrosis. Rarely hyperkeratosis on
      other areas may be seen (knees dorsal aspects of the digits). Histopatologically
      widened intercellular spaces between keratinocytes are observed.
