  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bone sarcoma characterized by a usually benign space-occupying
      lesion which is nevertheless locally aggressive and massively damaging to surrounding
      bone tissue. The tumor is composed of giant multinucleated cells (osteoclast-like
      cells) mononuclear macrophages and mononuclear stromal cells which secrete pro-myeloid
      and pro-osteoclastic factors. Metastasis and malignant transformation are rare
      but the recurrence rate is high.
