  TextSection:
    Contents: Sideroblastic anemias (SA) are a group of rare heterogeneous inherited
      or acquired bone marrow disorders isolated or part of a syndrome characterized
      by decreased hemoglobin synthesis because of defective use of iron (although
      plasmatic iron levels may be normal or elevated) and the presence of ringed
      sideroblasts in the bone marrow due to the pathologic iron overload in mitochondria
      as visualized by Perls' staining. The group encompasses (idiopathic) acquired
      sideroblastic anemia and constitutional sideroblastic anemias. The latter include
      syndromic sideroblastic anemias such as Pearson syndrome mitochondrial mypathy
      and sideroblastic anemias x-linked sideroblastic anemia-ataxia thiamine responsive
      megaloblastic anemia syndrome and nonsyndromic sideroblastic anemias comprising
      x-linked and autosomal recessive sideroblastic anemias.
