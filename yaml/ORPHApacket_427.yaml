  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hypoaldosteronism that typically presents in infancy
      (earl-onset familial hypoaldosternism) as a life-threatening electrolyte imbalance
      (failure to thrive recurrent vomiting and severe dehydration). A history of
      fever diarrhoea lethargy poor weight gain poor feeding since birth may also
      be present. Older subjects (late-onset familial hypoaldosteronism) are less
      severely affected or asymptomatic.
