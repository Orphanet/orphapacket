  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare and crippling chondrodysplasia reported mainly in the Maputaland
      region in northern Kwazulu Natal South Africa characterized by a bilateral and
      uniform arthropathy of the joints that primarily and most severely affects the
      hip but that can also affect many other joints (i.e. knees ankles wrists shoulders
      elbows) and that manifests with pain and stiffness that progressively limits
      joint movement eventually compromising a patient's ability to walk. Severe short
      staure and brachydactyly have been reported in a few patients with MJD.
