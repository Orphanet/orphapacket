  TextSection:
    Contents: Ichthyosis-hypotrichosis syndrome is characterised by congenital ichthyosis
      and hypotrichosis. It has been described in three members of a consanguineous
      Arab Israeli family. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait
      and is caused by a missense mutation in the <i>ST14</i> gene encoding the recently
      identified protease matriptase. Analysis of skin samples from the patients suggests
      that this enzyme plays a role in epidermal desquamation.
