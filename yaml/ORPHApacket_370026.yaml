  TextSection:
    Contents: A distinct form of Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which this chromosomal
      anomaly is found <i>de novo</i> or in therapy-related AML cases and is characterized
      by frequent extramedullary involvement (mainly hepatomegaly splenomegaly lymphadenopathies
      cutaneous infiltration but also gum bone central nervous system testicles involvement)
      severe coagulation disorder (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or primary
      fibrinolysis) and poor prognosis. Morphologically a blast population with a
      myelomonocytic stage of differentiation is observed.
