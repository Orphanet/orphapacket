    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral small vessel disease characterized by an adult-onset
      primary microangiopathy with severe atherosclerosis of arterioles and secondary
      leukoencephalopathy. Patients may present with migraine transient ischemic attacks
      stroke with central facial palsy cognitive dysfunction with impaired concentration
      dementia depression movement disorder vertigo dysphagia dysarthria sicca syndrome
      impaired REM sleep and therapy-resistant hypertension among others. Brain MRI
      typically shows a leukoencephalopathy that is disproportionately severe and
