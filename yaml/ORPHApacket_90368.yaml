    Contents: A rare alopecia characterized by scalp-limited progressive hair loss.
      Most of the patients present with normal hair at birth progressive hair loss
      starts during the first decade of life and leads to almost complete loss (sparse
      fine and short hairs may remain in some patients) of scalp hair by the third
      decade. Body axillary and facial hair (including eyebrows eye lashes and beard)
      are not affected. Teeth and nails develop normally.
