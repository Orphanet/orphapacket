  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare epilepsy syndrome characterized by absence seizures with perioral
      myoclonia as the main seizure type accompanied by generalized tonic-clonic seizures
      appearing before or together with absences. Consciousness is usually impaired
      although to variable degree. Commonly observed absence status epilepticus poor
      response to antiepileptic drugs and persistence of seizures into adulthood in
      the presence of normal neurological status and intelligence are additional clinical
      features of this syndrome.
