  TextSection:
    Contents: Mitral valve agenesis is a rare congenital heart malformation defined
      as an agenesis or severe hypoplasia of both mitral valve leaflets (complete
      agenesis) or one of the leaflets (partial agenesis). Complete mitral valve agenesis
      presents in the neonatal period with symptoms of severe mitral regurgitation
      and is rapidly fatal unless surgically treated. It is frequently associated
      with other heart malformations. Partial mitral valve agenesis may present at
      various ages usually with symptoms of mitral regurgitation.
