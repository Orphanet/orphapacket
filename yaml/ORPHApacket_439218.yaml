    Contents: KCNQ2-related epileptic encephalopathy is a severe form of neonatal
      epilepsy that usually manifests in newborns during the first week of life with
      seizures (that affect alternatively both sides of the body) often accompanied
      by clonic jerking or more complex motor behavior as well as signs of encephalopathy
      such as diffuse hypotonia limb spasticity lack of visual fixation and tracking
      and mild to moderate intellectual deficiency. The severity can range from controlled
      to intractable seizures and mild/moderate to severe intellectual disability.
