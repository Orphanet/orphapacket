  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic syndrome with peripheral neuropathy characterized
      by polyneuropathy hearing loss ataxia retinitis pigmentosa and cataracts. Polyneuropathy
      presents with slowly progressive and often demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy
      where pes cavus decreased sensation and hyporeflexia may appear as early signs.
      Hearing loss is progressive usually bilateral and presents with childhood/early
      adolescent-onset whereas patients develop retinis pigmentosa and cataracts (typically
      posterior subcapsular) often in early to mid-adulthood. Ataxia may manifest
      with gait instability/spasticity dysarthria intention tremor and dysmetria of
      the limbs. Additional clinical features may include tendon abnormalities hyperreflexia
      extensor plantar responses. Seizures and mild intellectual disability is reported
      in few patients.
