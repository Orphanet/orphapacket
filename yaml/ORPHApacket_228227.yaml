  TextSection:
    Contents: Late-onset focal dermal elastosis is a rare acquired dermis elastic
      tissue disorder characterized by a pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papular eruption
      consisting of multiple slowly progressive asymptomatic 2-5 mm white to yellowish
      non-follicular papules (that tend to form cobblestone plaques) predominantly
      distributed over the neck axillae and flexural areas with no systemic involvement.
      Skin biopsy reveals a focal increase of normal-appearing elastic tissue in the
      reticular dermis with no calcium deposits.
