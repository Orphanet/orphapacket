      of optic ataxia ocular apraxia and simultanagnosia due to posterior parietal
      lobe lesions. Patients report ophthalmologic difficulties in the absence of
      underlying ophthalomologic anomalies and present severe visual and spatial disabilities
      in locating and reaching objects initiating voluntary eye movements and perceiving
      more than one object at a time.
