    Contents: A rare genetic benign disorder of cobalamin transport due to variable
      degrees of transcobalamin I deficiency characterized by mildly low to almost
      undetectable plasma transcobalamin I levels and slighly low to absent serum
      cobalamin levels. Normal methylmalonic acid and homocysteine serum values and
      absence of megaloblastic anemia are reported. No specific clinical manifestations
      are associated and patients are typically asymptomatic.
