  TextSection:
    Contents: "Papillary renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma\
      \ arising from the renal tubular epithelium and showing a papillary growth pattern\
      \ which typically manifests with hematuria flank pain palpable abdominal mass\
      \ or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue weight loss or fever. Symptoms related\
      \ to metastatic spread such as bone pain or persistent cough are frequently\
      \ associated since early diagnosis is not common. It is typically multifocal\
      \ bilateral and in most cases sporadic although different hereditary syndromes\
      \ such as Hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma Birt-Hogg-Dub\xE9 syndrome\
      \ and Tuberous sclerosis may predispose to the development of papillary renal\
      \ cell carcinoma."
