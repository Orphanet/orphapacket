  TextSection:
    Contents: Papillary renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma
      arising from the renal tubular epithelium and showing a papillary growth pattern
      which typically manifests with hematuria flank pain palpable abdominal mass
      or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue weight loss or fever. Symptoms related
      to metastatic spread such as bone pain or persistent cough are frequently associated
      since early diagnosis is not common. It is typically multifocal bilateral and
      in most cases sporadic although different hereditary syndromes such as Hereditary
      leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma Birt-Hogg-Dub√© syndrome and Tuberous sclerosis
      may predispose to the development of papillary renal cell carcinoma.
