  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 4 is a rare mitochondrial
      disorder due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      a neonatal onset of severe metabolic acidosis and respiratory distress persistent
      lactic acidosis with episodes of metabolic crises developmental regression microcephaly
      abnormal gaze fixation and pursuit axial hypotonia with limb spasticity and
      reduced spontaneous movements. Neuroimaging studies reveal polymicrogyria white
      matter abnormalities and multiple cystic brain lesions including basal ganglia
      and cerebral atrophy. Decreased activity of complex I and IV have been determined
      in muscle biopsy.
