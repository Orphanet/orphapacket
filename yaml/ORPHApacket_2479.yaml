    Contents: Megalocornea-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare intellectual
      disability syndrome most commonly characterized by megalocornea congenital hypotonia
      varying degrees of intellectual disability psychomotor/developmental delay seizures
      and mild facial dysmorphism (including round face frontal bossing antimongoloid
      slant of the eyes epicanthal folds large low set ears broad nasal base anteverted
      nostrils and long upper lip). Interfamilial and intrafamilial clinical variability
