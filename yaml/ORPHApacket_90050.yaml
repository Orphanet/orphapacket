    Contents: A rare retinal vasoproliferative disease affecting preterm infants characterized
      initially by a delay in physiologic retinal vascular development and compromised
      physiologic vascularity and subsequently by aberrant angiogenesis in the form
      of intravitreal neovascularization.
