  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare type of hereditary spastic paraplegia usually characterized by
      a pure phenotype of proximal weakness of the lower extremities with spastic
      gait and brisk reflexes with a bimodal age of onset of either childhood or adulthood
      (>30 years). In some cases it can present as a complex phenotype with additional
      associated manifestations including peripheral neuropathy bulbar palsy (with
      dysarthria and dysphagia) distal amyotrophy and impaired distal vibration sense.
