  TextSection:
    Contents: Periodic paralysis with later-onset distal motor neuropathy is a rare
      genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by acute episodic muscle weakness
      in upper and lower extremities (which responds to acetazolamide treatment) associated
      with later-onset chronic slowly progressive distal axonal neuropathy.
