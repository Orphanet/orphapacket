  TextSection:
    Contents: Chronic intestinal failure (CIF) is a chronic type of intestinal failure
      characterized by a nonfunctioning small bowel (that may be reversible or irreversal)
      where the body is unable to maintain energy and nutritional needs through absorption
      of food or nutrients via the intestinal tract (despite being metabolically stable)
      and which therefore necessitates long-term parenteral feeding. CIF may be the
      result of congenital digestive diseases (such as gastroschisis atresia of small
      intestine) short bowel syndrome intra-abdominal or pelvic cancer or progressive
      and devastating gastrointestinal or systemic benign diseases (such as Crohn
      disease).
