  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic lethal multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome
      characterized by severe hydranencephaly and renal dysplasia or agenesis. Pregnancy
      is complicated by oligo- or anhydramnios leading to features of Potter sequence
      (including typical facies and microretrognathia limb contractures talipes equinovarus
      and pulmonary hypoplasia) in the fetus. Affected fetuses either die <i>in utero</i>
      or shortly after birth. Histology of the brain shows widespread presence of
      multinucleated neurons and glial cells.
