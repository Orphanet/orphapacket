  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic mastocytosis characterized by the presence of at least
      20% usually immature and atypical mast cells in bone marrow aspirate smears.
      In classic mast cell leukemia mast cells account for at least 10% of peripheral
      white blood cells although the aleukemic variant with less than 10% mast cells
      is more common. C-findings (cytopenias hepatomegaly ascites portal hypertension
      splenomegaly skeletal lesions malabsorption) indicative of organ damage due
      to mast cell infiltration are usually present at diagnosis while skin lesions
      are absent in most cases. Prognosis is generally poor.
