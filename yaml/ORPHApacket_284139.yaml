  TextSection:
    Contents: Larsen-like syndrome B3GAT3 type is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia
      characterized by laxity dislocations and contractures of the joints short stature
      foot deformities (e.g. clubfeet) broad tips of fingers and toes short neck dysmorphic
      facial features (hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures upturned nose
      with anteverted nares high arched palate) and various cardiac malformations.
      Severe disease is associated with multiple fractures osteopenia arachnodactyly
      and blue sclerae. A broad spectrum of additional features including scoliosis
      radio-ulnar synostosis mild developmental delay and various eye disorders (glaucoma
      amblyopia hyperopia astigmatism ptosis) are also reported.
