  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuro-ophthalmological disease characterized by progressive
      weakness of the external eye muscles resulting in bilateral ptosis and diffuse
      symmetric ophthalmoparesis. Additional signs may include generalized skeletal
      muscle weakness muscle atrophy sensory axonal neuropathy ataxia cardiomyopathy
      and psychiatric symptoms. It is usually more severe than autosomal dominant
      form.
