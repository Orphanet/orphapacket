  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cerebellar malformation characterized by congenital complete
      or partial fusion of the cerebellar hemispheres dentate nuclei and middle cerebellar
      peduncles and complete or partial absence of the vermis. It may occur as an
      isolated anomaly or together with other malformations of the brain and is associated
      with variable clinical manifestations including developmental delay ataxia dysarthria
      oculomotor abnormalities seizures and involuntary head movements among others.
