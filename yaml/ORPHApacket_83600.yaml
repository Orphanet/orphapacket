  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare brain inflammatory disease characterized by acute or subacute
      encephalitis with involvement of the midbrain and basal ganglia occurring in
      children as well as adults. Initial symptoms are pharyngitis and fever followed
      by progressive lethargy sleep disturbances extrapyramidal symptoms (parkinsonism
      chorea dystonia) neuropsychiatric manifestations (obsessive-compulsive behavior
      mutism catatonia) and ocular features (oculogyric crises). Autoantibodies against
      human basal ganglia are often positive. Survivors may develop post-encephalitic
      syndromes most prominently parkinsonism.
