  TextSection:
    Contents: Ileal neuroendocrine tumor is a rare primary malignant epithelial neoplasm
      of the small intestine arising from enterochromaffin cells in the ileum (usually
      the terminal ileum). Clinical behavior depends on the histologic grade but initially
      it is generally characterized by vague abdominal symptoms (cramping bloating
      diarrhea) with insidious onset although sometimes it could present with signs
      of bowel obstruction/perforation or gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis in
      advanced stages with regional or distant spread is common but signs of carcinoid
      syndrome (flushing sweating diarrhea) are usually not apparent until hepatic
      metastasis has occurred.
