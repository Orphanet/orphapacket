  TextSection:
    Contents: Thoracomelic dysplasia is an extremely rare primary bone dysplasia disorder
      characterized by a bell-shaped thorax disproportionate short stature pelvic
      hypoplasia dislocatable radial heads and elongated distal fibulae. No acetabular
      spurs nor phalangeal cone-shaped epiphyses are present and osseous manifestations
      tend to normalize with age. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1988.
