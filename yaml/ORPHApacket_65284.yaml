  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by subacute encephalopathy
      with confusion seizures and movement disorder often following a history of febrile
      illness. Imaging may reveal bilateral lesions in the basal ganglia. The disease
      usually becomes symptomatic in childhood and is life-threatening if left untreated
      but symptoms can be reversed and progression prevented by treatment with high
      doses of biotin and thiamine.
