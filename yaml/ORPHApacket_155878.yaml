  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of cleft palate characterized by congenital muscular diastasis
      of the soft palate along the midline with an intact oral and nasal mucosal lining.
      It is diagnosed by the triad of a bifid uvula a translucent zone in the soft
      palate and a bony notch in the posterior edge of the hard palate all of which
      may vary in severity. Velopharyngeal insufficiency in the absence of this triad
      is classified as occult submucosal cleft palate. Patients may be asymptomatic
      or present with early feeding problems with fluid reflux through the nose speech
      problems recurrent otitis media with effusions and hearing loss.
