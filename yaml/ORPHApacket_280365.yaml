  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare familial partial lipodystrophy characterized by severe partial
      lipoatrophy affecting the limbs trunk and abdomen together with faciocervical
      fat accumulation. Additional manifestations include diabetes acanthosis nigricans
      liver steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia as well as low serum leptin and adiponectin
      levels. Severe cardiac rhythm and conduction disturbances have also been reported.
