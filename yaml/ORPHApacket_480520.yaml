  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hepatic disease characterized by multiple segmental cystic
      dilatations of both central and smaller peripheral bile ducts associated with
      congenital hepatic fibrosis. Age of symptom onset is variable as is disease
      progression. Patients present recurrent cholangitis hepatolithiasis and cholecystolithiasis.
      Portal hypertension may appear later in the disease course and the risk of developing
      cholangiocarcinoma is increased significantly. The syndrome is often associated
      with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.
