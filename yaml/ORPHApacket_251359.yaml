  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy that affects red blood cells both in
      the production of abnormal hemoglobin as well as the decreased synthesis of
      beta globin chains. Clinical manifestations depend on the amount of residual
      beta globin chains production and are similar to sickle cell disease including
      anemia vascular occlusion and its complications acute episodes of pain acute
      chest syndrome pulmonary hypertension sepsis ischemic brain injury splenic sequestration
