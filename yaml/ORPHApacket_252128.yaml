    Contents: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with perineurial differentiation
      is a rare soft tissue sarcoma composed predominantly of spindle-shaped neoplastic
      cells showing perineurial differentiation and displaying abundant cellular pleomorphism
      or anaplasia frequent mitoses tumor necrosis and high metastatic potential.
      It often presents as a soft painless solid mass in subcutaneous tissues of the
