  TextSection:
    Contents: Mucopolysaccharidosis type 2 attenuated form (MPS2att) the less severe
      form of MPS2 (see this term) leads to a massive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
      and a wide variety of symptoms including distinctive facies short stature cardiorespiratory
      and skeletal findings. It is differentiated from mucopolysaccharidosis type
      2 severe form (see this term) by the absence of cognitive decline.
