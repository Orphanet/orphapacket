  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 is a multiple epiphyseal dysplasia
      characterized by an early-onset of pain and stiffness (involving knee and hip)
      progressive deformity of the extremities and precocious osteoarthritis associated
      with delayed and irregular ossification of epiphyses. Features specific to multiple
      epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 include normal stature and lesser incidence of gait
      abnormalities. Radiographs reveal epiphyseal and metaphyseal irregularities.
      Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia type 5 follows an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.
