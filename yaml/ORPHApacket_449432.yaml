  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare IgG4-related disease characterized by a benign tumor-like chronic
      inflammatory lesion of the submandibular gland. Histologic features are periductal
      fibrosis acinar atrophy obliterative phlebitis dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates
      rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells and formation of lymphoid follicles. Lobular
      architecture is preserved. Patients most commonly present with unilateral painless
      swelling of the submandibular gland. Serologic analysis reveals elevated IgG4
      levels.
