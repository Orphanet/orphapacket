  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 46 (SPG46) is a rare complex
      type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by an onset in infancy or
      childhood of the typical signs of spastic paraplegia (i.e. spastic gait and
      weakness of the lower limbs) associated with a variety of additional manifestations
      including upper limb spasticity and weakness pseudobulbar dysarthria bladder
      dysfunction cerebellar ataxia cataracts and cognitive impairment that can progress
      to dementia. Brain imaging may show thinning of the corpus callosum and mild
      atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum. SPG46 is due to mutations in the <i>GBA2</i>
      gene (9p13.2) encoding non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase.
