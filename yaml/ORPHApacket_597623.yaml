  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by childhood onset
      of severe global neurodevelopmental regression with eventual loss of independent
      walking and loss of language and fine and gross motor skills and development
      of severe dysphagia requiring tube feeding seizures cerebellar syndrome dystonia
      and other neurologic manifestations. Brain imaging shows progressive cerebral
      and/or cerebellar atrophy in most cases. A less severe phenotype associated
      with missense mutations shows no regression or movement abnormalities ambulation
      is preserved and brain imaging is normal.
