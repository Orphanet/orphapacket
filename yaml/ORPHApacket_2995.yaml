  TextSection:
    Contents: Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BWS) is a malformation syndrome characterized
      by facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism with ptosis broad bulbous nose ridged metopic
      suture arched eyebrows progressive coarsening of the face) ocular coloboma pachygyria
      and/or band heterotopias with antero-posterior gradient progressive joint stiffening
      and intellectual deficit of variable severity often with severe epilepsy. Pachygyria
      - epilepsy - intellectual disability - dysmorphism (Fryns-Aftimos syndrome (FA);
      see this term) corresponds to the appearance of BWS in elderly patients.
