  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by juvenile-onset insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus associated with central and peripheral nervous system abnormalities
      with variable onset between infancy and adolescence. Neurological manifestations
      include combined cerebellar and afferent ataxia sensorineural hearing loss pyramidal
      tract signs and demyelinating sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy. Hypothyroidism
      has been reported in some patients. Brain imaging may show generalized cerebral
      atrophy.
