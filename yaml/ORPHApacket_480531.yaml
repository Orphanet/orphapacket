  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital portosystemic shunt is a rare congenital anomaly of the great
      veins characterized by an abnormal communication between one or more veins of
      the portal and the caval systems resulting in complete or partial diversion
      of the portal blood away from the liver to the systemic circulation. Clinical
      manifestations include liver atrophy hypergalactosemia without uridine diphosphate
      enzyme deficiency hyperammonemia encephalopathy (resulting in learning disabilities
      extreme fatigability and seizures) pulmonary hypertension hypoxemia from hepatopulmonary
      syndrome and benign or malignant tumours.
