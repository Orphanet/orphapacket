  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare tetrogenic embryofetopathy due to exposure to isotretinoin an
      oral synthetic vitamin A derivative which is used to treat severe recalcitrant
      cystic acne. Exposure to isotretinoin during the first trimester of pregnancy
      has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and severe
      birth defects including serious craniofacial (microcephaly asymmetric crying
      facies microphthalmia developmental abnormalities of the external ear ocular
      hypertelorism) cardio vascular (conotruncal heart defects aortic arch abnormalities)
      and central nervous system (hydrocephalus microcephaly lissencephaly Dandy-Walker
      malformation cognitive deficit) anomalies and thymic aplasia.
