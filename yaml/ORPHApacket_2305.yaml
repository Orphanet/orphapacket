    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Isotretinoin embryopathy is an association of malformations caused by
      the teratogenic effect of isotretinoin an oral synthetic vitamin A derivative
      which is used to treat severe recalcitrant cystic acne. Exposure to isotretinoin
      during the first trimester of pregnancy has been associated with an increased
      risk of spontaneous abortions and severe birth defects including serious craniofacial
      (microcephaly asymmetric crying facies microphthalmia developmental abnormalities
      of the external ear ocular hypertelorism) cardio vascular (conotruncal heart
      defects aortic arch abnormalities) and central nervous system (hydrocephalus
      microcephaly lissencephaly Dandy-Walker malformation cognitive deficit) anomalies
      and thymic aplasia. Isoretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy.
