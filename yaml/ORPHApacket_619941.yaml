  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficieny due to a defect in innate immunity characterized
      by infantile-onset severe recurrent bacterial infections. Patients may present
      with septic shock meningitis progressive and severe pneumonia (mostly associated
      with <i>Pseudomonas</i> infection) malignant otitis media cutaneous and subcutaneous
      abscesses and poor wound healing. Severe impairment in neutrophil phagocytosis/migration
      are reported in all patients. Mild thrombocytopenia can also be present.
