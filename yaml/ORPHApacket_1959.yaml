  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chronic hematologic disorder characterized by the simultaneous
      or sequential association of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA; a disorder in
      which auto-antibodies are directed against red blood cells causing anemia of
      varying degrees of severity) with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP; a coagulation
      disorder in which auto-antibodies are directed against platelets causing hemorrhagic
      episodes) and occasionally autoimmune neutropenia in the absence of a known
      underlying etiology.
