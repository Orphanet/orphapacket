  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic inborn error of branched-chain amino acid metabolism
      disorder with a highly variable clinical and biochemical phenotype typically
      characterized by mild to severe global developmental delay elevated methylmalonic
      acid and occasionally lactic acid plasma levels and chronic methylmalonic aciduria
      which may be accompanied by elevation of additional organic or amino acids in
      urine (e.g. beta-alanine methionine 3-hydroxypropionic 3-aminoisobutyric and/or
      3-hydroxyisobutyric acid). Microcephaly mild craniofacial dysmorphism axial
      hypotonia liver failure and central nervous system abnormalities on MRI have
      also been reported.
