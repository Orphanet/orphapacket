  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital factor XIII deficiency is an inherited bleeding disorder
      due to reduced levels and activity of factor XIII (FXIII) and characterized
      by hemorrhagic diathesis frequently associated with spontaneous abortions and
      defective wound healing. Factor XIII deficiency is one of the most rare coagulation
      factor deficiencies.
