  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic axial skeletal dysostosis characterized by multiple segmentation
      defects of the vertebrae in combination with abnormalities of the ribs (malalignment
      intercostal fusion and possible reduction in rib number) leading to short trunk
      in proportion to height short neck and non-progressive scoliosis that is typically
      mild.
