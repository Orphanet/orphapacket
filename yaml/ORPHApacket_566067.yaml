      by a combination of autoinflammation immunodeficiency and neutrophil dysfunction
      as well as mild bleeding diathesis. Patients present recurrent attacks of abdominal
      pain high fever and systemic inflammation lasting four to five days and occurring
      every few weeks. Attacks may be accompanied by nailbed tongue submandibular
