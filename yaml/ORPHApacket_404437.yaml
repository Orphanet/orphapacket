  TextSection:
    Contents: Diffuse cerebral and cerebellar atrophy-intractable seizures-progressive
      microcephaly syndrome is a rare genetic central nervous system malformation
      syndrome characterized by congenital progressive microcephaly neonatal to infancy-onset
      of severe intractable seizures and diffuse cerebral cortex and cerebellar vermis
      atrophy with mild cerebellar hemisphere atrophy associated with profound global
      developmental delay. Hypotonia or hypertonia with brisk reflexes variable dysmorphic
      facial features ophthalmological signs (cortical visual impairment nystagmus
      eye deviation) and episodes of sudden extreme agitation caused by severe illness
      may also be associated.
