  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic central nervous system malformation syndrome characterized
      by congenital progressive microcephaly neonatal to infancy-onset of severe intractable
      seizures and diffuse cerebral cortex and cerebellar vermis atrophy with mild
      cerebellar hemisphere atrophy associated with profound global developmental
      delay. Hypotonia or hypertonia with brisk reflexes variable dysmorphic facial
      features ophthalmological signs (cortical visual impairment nystagmus eye deviation)
      and episodes of sudden extreme agitation caused by severe illness may also be
      associated.
