  TextSection:
    Contents: Hallermann-Streiff syndrome is a rare genetic syndrome characterized
      mainly by head and facial abnormalities such as bird-like facies (with beak-shaped
      nose and retrognathia) hypoplastic mandible brachycephaly with frontal bossing
      dental abnormalities (e.g. absence of teeth natal teeth supernumerary teeth
      severe agenesis of permanent teeth enamel hypoplasia) hypotrichosis various
      ophthalmic disorders (e.g. congenital cataracts bilateral microphthalmia ptosis
      nystagmus) and atrophy of skin (especially around the center of face and nose)
      as well as telangiectasia and proportionate short stature. Intellectual disability
      is reported in some cases.
