  TextSection:
    Contents: '12q14 microdeletion syndrome is characterised by mild intellectual
      deficit failure to thrive short stature and osteopoikilosis. It has been described
      in four unrelated patients. The syndrome appears to be caused by a heterozygous
      deletion at chromosome region 12q14 which was detected in three of the four
      patients. The deleted region contains the <i>LEMD3</i> gene: mutations in this
      gene have already been implicated in osteopoikilosis.'
