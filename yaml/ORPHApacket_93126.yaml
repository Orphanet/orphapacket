  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare small vessel vasculitis associated with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
      (GN) and clinically characterized by renal manifestations such as urinary abnormalities
      (hematuria and/or proteinuria) and hypertension leading to renal failure within
      days or weeks and distinguished by the absence of immune deposits on immunofluorescent
      microscopy. The disease can occur as a renal-limited disease or as a component
      of systemic necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis.
