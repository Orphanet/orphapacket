      characterized by pre- and/or postnatal growth retardation variable intellectual
      disability short stature dysmorphic features (microcephaly triangular facies
      frontal bossing hypertelorism ear anomaly broad nasal bridge highly arched palate
      micrognathism) hand and feet anomalies (e.g. brachydactyly clinodactyly syndactyly)
      and multiple hyperpigmented and/or hypopigmented spots. Severe phenotypes present
      with cardiac abnormalities and/or renal malformations. Other reported features
