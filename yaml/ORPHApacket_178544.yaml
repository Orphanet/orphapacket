    Contents: A rare aggressive primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma characterized by
      rapidly progressive red to bluish often ulcerating nodular tumors predominantly
      involving the lower legs. Histology shows sheets of centroblasts and immunoblasts
      that spare the epidermis but infiltrate the dermis and subcutaneous tissues
      and often disseminate extracutaneously. The neoplastic cells typically express
      CD20 CD79a Bcl-2 MUM-1 and FOXP1 but are negative for CD10.
