  TextSection:
    Contents: Sterile multifocal osteomyelitis with periostitis and pustulosis is
      a rare severe genetic autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by usually neonatal
      onset of generalized neutrophilic cutaneous pustulosis and severe recurrent
      multifocal aseptic osteomyelitis with marked periostitis typically affecting
      distal ribs long bones and vertebral bodies. High levels of acute-phase reactants
      (with no fever associated) and onychosis are frequently observed additional
      features.
