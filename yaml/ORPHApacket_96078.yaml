  TextSection:
    Contents: '16p13.3 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from a partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 16 and manifesting
      with a variable phenotype which is mostly characterized by: mild to moderate
      intellectual deficit and developmental delay (particularly speech) normal growth
      short proximally implanted thumbs and other hand and feet malformations (such
      as camptodactyly syndactyly club feet) mild arthrogryposis and characteristic
      facies (upslanting narrow palpebral fissures hypertelorism mid face hypoplasia
      bulbous nasal tip and low set ears). Other reported manifestations include cryptorchidism
      inguinal hernia and behavioral problems.'
