  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) characterized
      by neocortical and severe cerebral cortical atrophy associated with pontocerebellar
      hypoplasia with the pons and cerebellum equally affected. Clinically the disorder
      manifests at birth with hypotonia clonus epilepsy impaired swallowing and from
      infancy by progressive microcephaly spasticity and lactic acidosis.
