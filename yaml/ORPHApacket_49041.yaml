  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by mass-forming potentially
      destructive inflammation and fibrosis in the soft tissues of the retroperitoneum
      associated with elevation of serum IgG4 levels and infiltration of IgG4-positive
      plasma cells in at least one organ or site. Most frequent locations are peripheral
      to the abdominal aorta as well as the iliac and renal arteries. Clinical symptoms
      are unspecific and include abdominal pain back pain and edema of the lower extremities.
      The condition may occur together with IgG4-related disease in other parts of
      the body.
