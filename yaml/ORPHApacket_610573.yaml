  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by childhood-onset
      severe developmental delay with regression poor motor development speech impairment
      and hypotonia due to CLCN6 mutations. Most of the patients have vision abnormalities
      respiratory system abnormalities (including chronic respiratory insufficiency
      and tracheostomy that may lead to ventilator dependency) and feeding difficulties
      (percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy). Skin abnormalities including hyperhidrosis
      can be present.
