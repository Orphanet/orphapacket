  TextSection:
    Contents: Cyclosporosis is a parasitic disease caused by <i>Cyclospora cayetanensis</i>
      a recently discovered coccidia that was initially described in Peru and then
      in most intertropical zones. Infection occurs through ingestion of contaminated
      food or water and leads to abdominal pain anorexia and diarrhoea which may resolve
      spontaneously in immunocompetent individuals but may persist in a chronic form
      in immunocompromised subjects leading to a decline in their general state of
      health.
