  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inflammatory eye disease characterized by IgG4-immunopositive
      lymphocyte and plasmacyte infiltration and collagenous fibrosis of affected
      tissue and elevated serum levels of IgG4. Clinical presentation includes mass
      lesion or swelling of the involved structures commonly involving lacrimal gland
      and duct infraorbital and supraorbital nerves extraocular muscles and orbital
      soft tissues. A systemic involvement is common.
