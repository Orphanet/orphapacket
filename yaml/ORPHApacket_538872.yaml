    Contents: A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by a solitary
      erythematous ulcerated plaque which lacks the violaceous border typically present
      in classic pyoderma gangrenosum usually affecting individuals who are otherwise
      healthy. Histologically the lesion presents a central layer containing neutrophilic
      inflamation surrounded by a palisade of histiocytes which are rimmed by a lymphocytic
      infiltrate. In comparison with the other variants of pyoderma gangrenosum this
      subtype usually shows a good response to less aggressive treatments and underlying
      systemic disorders are less frequently associated. It is considered the most
      benign and uncommon clinical variant of pyoderma gangrenosum.
