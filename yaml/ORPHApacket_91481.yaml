  TextSection:
    Contents: Ring dermoid of cornea is characterised by annular limbal dermoids (growths
      with a skin-like structure) with corneal and conjunctival extension. Less than
      30 cases have been described. Transmission is autosomal dominant and mutations
      in the <i>PITX2</i> gene have been suggested as a potential cause of the condition.
