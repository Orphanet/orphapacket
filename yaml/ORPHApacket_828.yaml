  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare group of genetic connective tissue disorders characterized by
      ophthalmic auditory orofacial and articular manifestations. The two main clinical
      forms are clinically distinguished by the vitreous phenotype; stickler type
      1 by a vestigial vitreous gel in the immediate retrolental space bordered by
      a distinct folded membrane and Stickler type 2 by sparse and irregularly thickened
      bundles of &#64257;bers throughout the vitreous cavity.
