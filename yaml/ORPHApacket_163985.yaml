  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability disease characterized
      by neonatal hypertonia which evolves to hypotonia and an exaggerated startle
      response (to sudden visual auditory or tactile stimuli) followed by the development
      of early-onset frequently refractory tonic or myoclonic seizures. Progressive
      epileptic encephalopathy intellectual disability and psychomotor development
      arrest with subsequent decline may be additionally associated.
