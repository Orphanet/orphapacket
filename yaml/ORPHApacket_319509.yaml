  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 9 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      initially normal growth and development followed by the infantile-onset of failure
      to thrive psychomotor delay poor feeding dyspnea severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
      and hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies report increased plasma lactate and alanine
      abnormal liver enzymes and decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain
      complexes I III IV and V.
