  TextSection:
    Contents: Male infertility due to globozoospermia is a male infertility due to
      sperm disorder characterized by the presence in sperm of a large majority of
      round-headed spermatozoa that lack the acrosome and have an aberrant nuclear
      membrane and midpiece defects. The acrosomeless spermatozoa is not able to penetrate
      the zona pellucida and thus fertilization failures even with intracytoplasmic
      sperm injection are frequent.
