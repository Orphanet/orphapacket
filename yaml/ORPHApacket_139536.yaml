  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant distal hereditary motor neuropathy disease
      characterized by muscle weakness and wasting predominantly affecting the hands
      in particular the thenar and first dorsal interosseus muscles and/or marked
      foot deformity and gait disturbance. Sensation is normal although reduced response
      to vibration has been described. The disease is slowly progressive with an age
      of onset within the first few decades of life.
