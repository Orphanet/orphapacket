  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dysplastic cortical hyperostosis characterized by brachycephaly
      short poorly modeled tubular bones with wide diaphysis and smooth rounded metaphyses
      extremities with severe brachydactyly and facial dysmorphism (including flat
      face hypertelorism and low-set ears). Additional clinical features include hypoplastic
      thorax and hypertrichosis. Histology of the bone tissue and the growth plate
      are normal. It is a lethal condition associated to severe fetal hydrops and
      polyhydramnios.
