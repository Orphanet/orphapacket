  TextSection:
    Contents: Resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) syndrome is a type
      of central congenital hypothyroidism (see this term) characterized by low levels
      of thyroid hormones due to insufficient release of thyroid-stimulating hormone
      (TSH) caused by pituitary resistance to TRH. It may or may not be observed from
      birth.
