  TextSection:
    Contents: Resistance to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) syndrome is a type
      of central congenital hypothyroidism characterized by low levels of thyroid
      hormones due to insufficient release of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) caused
      by pituitary resistance to TRH. It may or may not be observed from birth.
