  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by hypogonadism
      due to selective deficiency of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Clinical
      manifestations are primary amenorrhea absent or incomplete breast development
      and infertility in women and small testes azoospermia and infertility in men.
      Luteinizing hormone is elevated in the gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation
      test while the FSH response is impaired.
