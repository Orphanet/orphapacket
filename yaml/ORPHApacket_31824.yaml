    Contents: Colchicine poisoning is a potentially life-threatening poisoning due
      to ingestion of the drug or consumption of the plant <i>Colchicum autumnale</i>
      that usually begins with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain nausea
      vomiting and diarrhea that cause severe dehydration) and an initial leukocytosis
      leading to marrow failure (24 hours after ingestion) followed by potentially
      fatal multi-organ failure with mental status change oliguric renal failure disseminated
      intravascular coagulation electrolyte imbalance acid-base disturbance cardiac
      failure/arrest and shock within 1-3 days.
