  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndrome with limb malformations as a major feature characterized
      by preaxial polydactyly of the hands and feet with variable phenotypic expressivity
      in combination with hypertrichosis extending from the posterior hairline to
      the middle of the back. Reported limb malformations include triphalangeal thumbs
      duplicated thumbs preaxial extra ray and syndactyly between digits I and II
      in the hands and large or duplicated hallux and syndactyly between toes I and
      II in the feet.
