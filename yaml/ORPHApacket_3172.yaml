  TextSection:
    Contents: Eyebrow duplication-syndactyly syndrome is characterised by partial
      duplication of the eyebrows and syndactyly of the fingers and toes. It has been
      described in three patients (a brother and sister and an isolated case). Skin
      hyperelasticity hypertrichosis and long eyelashes and abnormal periorbital wrinkling
      were also reported in some of the patients. Transmission is autosomal recessive.
