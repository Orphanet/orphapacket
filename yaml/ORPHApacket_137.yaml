  TextSection:
    Contents: A fast growing group of inborn errors of metabolism characterized by
      defective activity of enzymes that participate in glycosylation (modification
      of proteins and other macromolecules by adding and processing of oligosaccharide
      side chains). This group is comprised of phenotypically diverse disorders affecting
      multiple systems including the central nervous system muscle function immunity
      endocrine system and coagulation. The numerous entities in this group are subdivided
      based on the synthetic pathway affected into disorder of protein N-glycosylation
      disorder of protein O-glycosylation disorder of multiple glycosylation and disorder
      of glycosphingolipid and glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor glycosylation.
