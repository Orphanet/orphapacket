  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) historically characterized
      by symmetric proximal muscle weakness elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase)
      myopathic findings on electromyography and muscle biopsy showing endomyial infiltration
      composed mainly of macrophages and lymphocytes. The features are non-specific
      thus the disease should be distinguished from similar entities with specific
      clinical immunological histological features notably dermatomyositis immune-mediated
      necrotizing myopathy anti-synthetase syndrome inclusion body myositis and myositis
      associated with other connective tissue disorder.
