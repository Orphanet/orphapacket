  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by significant visual dysfunction
      that cannot be explained by ocular abnormalities alone and is due to damage
      to post-chiasmatic visual pathways and structures during early perinatal development.
      Signs and symptoms include decreased visual acuity visual field defects and
      impairments in visual processing and attention.
