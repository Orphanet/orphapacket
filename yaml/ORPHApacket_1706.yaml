  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 15 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome principally
      characterized by intrauterine growth restriction congenital cardiac anomalies
      (incl. ventricular and atrial septal defects patent ductus arteriosus) and craniofacial
      dysmorphism (incl. hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures wide nasal
      bridge). Patients also present brain (e.g. hypoplastic cerebellum ventricular
      asymmetry) renal (e.g. small dysplastic kidneys) and/or genital (undescended
      testis small penis hypoplastic labia majora) anomalies. Digital and skin pigmentation
      abnormalities have also been reported.
