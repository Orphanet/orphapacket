  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare photodermatosis characterized by the development of pruritic
      or painful vesicles in a photodistributed pattern in response to sunlight exposure.
      The lesions heal with permanent varioliform scarring. Ocular involvement deformities
      of ears and nose or contractures of the fingers may occasionally be observed.
      Systemic signs and symptoms are absent. The condition typically occurs in childhood
      and regresses spontaneously in adolescence or young adulthood.
