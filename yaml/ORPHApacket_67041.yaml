  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of mucopolysaccharidosis characterized by abnormal storage
      of hyaluronan in lysosomes due to deficiency of hyaluronidase 1. Clinical manifestations
      include knee and/or hip pain associated with swelling diffuse joint involvement
      with proliferative synovitis and occurrence of multiple periarticular soft-tissue
      masses short stature and dysmorphic craniofacial features (such as flattened
      nasal bridge bifid uvula and cleft palate).
