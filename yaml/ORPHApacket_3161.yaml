  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital pulmonary sequestration is a rare respiratory malformation
      characterized by a cystic or solid mass of nonfunctioning primitive segmental
      lung tissue that does not communicate with the tracheobronchial tree and has
      anomalous systemic blood supply. Intralobar pulmonary sequestration may be asymptomatic
      or may present with recurrent pulmonary infections hemoptysis chest pain cough
      and is usually diagnosed in older children and adults. Extralobar pulmonary
      sequestration present with respiratory distress cyanosis difficulty feeding
      or infection may be associated with other anomalies and is mostly diagnosed
      in neonates or infants.
