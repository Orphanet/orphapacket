    Contents: A rare hereditary amyloidosis with primary renal involvement characterized
      by fibrinogen A-alpha-chain amyloid deposition predominantly in the kidney glomeruli
      and clinically presenting with hypertension uremia nephrotic syndrome slowly
      progressing to end-stage renal disease. Extra-renal involvement is possible
      due to neurological cardiac visceral and vascular amyloid deposition.
