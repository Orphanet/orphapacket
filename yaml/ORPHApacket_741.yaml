  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare familial congenital mitral malformation characterized by systolic
      displacement of one or both mitral leaflets >2 mm beyond the annular plane into
      the left atrium. Typical histological findings include myxomatous degeneration
      and degradation of collagen and elastin. Patients may remain asymptomatic or
      develop complications such as severe mitral regurgitation endocarditis and heart
      failure.
