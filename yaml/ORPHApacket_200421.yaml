    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased
      susceptibility to recurrent usually severe infections (particularly by <i> Neisseria
      meningitidis</i> <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i>)
      renal impairment and/or autoimmune diseases typically manifesting with otitis
      media bronchitis meningitis and/or septicemia as well as hematuria/proteinuria
      asthma nephrotic syndrome hemolytic uremic syndrome glomerulonephritis and/or
      systemic lupus erythematosus. Laboratory serum analysis reveals in addition
      to factor H deficiency decreased complement factor B properdin complement C3
      and terminal complement components.
