  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of sialic acid metabolism characterized by excretion
      of large quantities of free sialic acid (predominantly N-acetylneuraminic acid
      without any morphologic evidence of storage within any subcellular organelle)
      mildly coarse facial features and hepatosplenomegaly. Growth and development
      are rather normal however some affected individuals were reported to have moderate
      developmental delay slight motor delay and mild intellectual impairment. Additional
      clinical features may involve macrocephaly mild small airway obstruction frequent
      upper respiratory tract infections transient failure to thrive seizures and
      sleep apnea. Signs and symptoms can be transient especially in infancy.
