  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by muscle
      weakness and progressive generalized hypotonia due to depletion of mtDNA in
      skeletal muscles. Clinical progression ranges from rapid and early fatal course
      due to respiratory failure to slowly progressive myopathy over the course of
      childhood or even early adulthood.
