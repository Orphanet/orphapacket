  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome with 46,XY difference of sex development characterized
      by mild developmental delay and streak gonads associated with short stature
      cardiac renal musculoskeletal and ectodermal abnormalities (the latter including
      scalp defects and unusual hair whorls) and dysmorphic facial features (such
      as preauricular pits short columella and small nares). There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1980.
