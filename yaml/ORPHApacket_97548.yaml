  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare heterotaxia characterized by complex congenital heart malformations
      and abnormal lateralization of other thoracic and abdominal organs due to embryonic
      disruption of the left-right axis development. Cardiac defects include dextrocardia
      or mesocardia common atrioventricular valve associated with complete atrioventricular
      septal defect or common atrium transposition or malposition of the great arteries
      and total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage among others. Cardiac arrhythmias
      are frequently observed. Typical abnormalities of other organs are bilateral
      trilobed lungs midline liver and asplenia. Patients present in the newborn period
      with severe cardiac failure and cyanosis. Prognosis is poor.
