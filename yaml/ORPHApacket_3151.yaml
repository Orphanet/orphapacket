  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple sclerosis-ichthyosis-factor VIII deficiency syndrome is characterized
      by the association of multiple sclerosis with lamellar ichthyosis and hematological
      anomalies (beta thalassemia minor and a quantitative deficit of factor VIII-von
      Willebrand complex). Other clinical manifestations may include eye involvement
      (optic atrophy diplopia) neuromuscular involvement (ataxia pyramidal syndrome
      gait disturbance) and sensory disorder. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1992.
