  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-dystrophic myofibrillar myopathy disorder characterized
      by late-adult onset of distal and/or proximal limb muscle weakness with initial
      involvement of posterior lower leg muscles medial gastrocnemius and soleus.
      Patients present with ankle weakness followed by weakness of finger and wrist
      extensors and later on of proximal muscles. Ambulation is usually preserved.
      Late-onset associated cardiomyopathy and/or neuropathy has been reported in
      a minority of cases.
