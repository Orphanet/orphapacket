  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized most typically by targetoid papules
      with 3-rings of concentric color variation (dark center surrounded by lighter
      pink ring and an outer red ring) symmetrically distributed on the extensor surfaces
      of the extremities or more diffuse accompanied by 2 or more mucosal involvements
      (erosions of the oral genital anal mucosa conjunctivitis pseudomembranes). The
      condition is commonly proceeded by prodromal symptoms of malaise fever and myalgias
      and is usually self-limiting resolving within a few weeks; although there is
      a risk of recurrence. The disease is mostly triggered by infectious agents (herpes
      virus <i>mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>) but a subset of patients have auto-antibodies
      targeting plakins. Rare cases of severe mucosal sequelae have been described.
