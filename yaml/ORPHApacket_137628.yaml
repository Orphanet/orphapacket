  TextSection:
    Contents: Cardiac anomalies-heterotaxy syndrome is characterised by non-compaction
      of the ventricular myocardium bradycardia pulmonary valve stenosis and secundum
      atrial septal defect. Laterality sequence anomalies are also present. So far
      the syndrome has been described in nine members from three generations of the
      same family. Transmission is autosomal dominant and linkage to chromosome 6p24.3-21.2
      was reported.
