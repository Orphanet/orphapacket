  TextSection:
    Contents: "Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a rare\
      \ immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by a narrow vulnerability to poorly\
      \ virulent mycobacteria such as bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) vaccines and\
      \ environmental mycobacteria (EM) and defined by severe recurrent infections\
      \ either disseminated or localized."
