    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) is a rare
      immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by a narrow vulnerability to poorly
      virulent mycobacteria such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines and environmental
      mycobacteria (EM) and defined by severe recurrent infections either disseminated
      or localized.
