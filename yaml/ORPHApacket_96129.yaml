  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal monosomy 19p13.3 is a rare chromosomal anomaly associated with
      a wide range of phenotypic features depending on the size of the deletion. It
      may present with intrauterine growth retardation failure to thrive global developmental
      delay dysmorphic features (such as broad forehead midface retrusion broad nasal
      bridge micrognathia smooth philtrum low-set dysplastic ears) congenital anomalies
      (such as atrial septal defect gastrointestinal anomalies renal and urogenital
      malformations agenesis of the corpus callosum) and other clinical features (such
      as hearing loss visual impairment and immune dysregulation).
