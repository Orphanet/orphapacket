    Contents: Sensorineural deafness with dilated cardiomyopathy is an extremely rare
      autosomal dominant syndrome described in two families to date and characterized
      by moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss manifesting during childhood
      and associated with late-onset dilated cardiomyopathy that generally progresses
      to heart failure.
