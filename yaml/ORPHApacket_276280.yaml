  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemihyperplasia-multiple lipomatosis syndrome is a rare genetic overgrowth
      syndrome characterized by non- progressive asymmetrical moderate hemihyperplasia
      (frequently affecting the limbs) associated with slow growing painless multiple
      recurrent subcutaneous lipomatous masses distributed throughout entire body
      (in particular back torso extremities fingers axillae). Superficial vascular
      malformations may also be associated. Increased risk of intra-abdominal embryonal
      malignancies may be associated.
