  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vaginal malformation characterized by the presence of a complete
      or incomplete transverse septum at any level of the vagina (most frequently
      the upper or middle third) resulting from incomplete fusion between the MÃ¼llerian
      duct component and the urogenital sinus component of the vagina during embryogenesis.
      The condition is only rarely diagnosed in neonates or infants unless it causes
      significant hydromucocolpos. Complete septa present with primary amenorrhea
      cyclic pelvic pain dyspareunia or a pelvic mass consisting of accumulated menstrual
      blood while incomplete septa may lead to dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea.
