  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by neonatal hypotonia
      life-threatening respiratory failure and feeding difficulties furthermore by
      delayed motor development severe muscle weakness predominantly affecting axial
      muscles (leading to poor head control rigid cervical spine and severe scoliosis)
      generalized joint laxity with no or mild contractures as well as dry skin with
      follicular hyperkeratosis. Serum creatine kinase is normal or slightly elevated.
      Muscle biopsy shows fiber size variability rounded fibers with mild increase
      of endomysial connective tissue and adipose replacement abundant minicore lesions
      increase of centrally located nuclei angular fibers and cap lesions.
