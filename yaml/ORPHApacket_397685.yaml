  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Familial hyperprolactinemia is a rare genetic endocrine disorder characterized
      by persistently high prolactin serum levels (not associated with gestation puerperium
      drug intake or pituitary tumor) in multiple members of a family. Clinically
      it manifests with signs usually observed in hyperprolactinemia which are: secondary
      medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-negative amenorrhea and galactorrhea in female
      patients and hypogonadism and decreased testosterone level-driven sexual dysfunction
      in male patients. Oligomenorrhea and primary infertility have also been reported
      in some female patients.'
