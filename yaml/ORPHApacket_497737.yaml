  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare nevus characterized by single or multiple non-inflammatory verrucous
      skin lesions composed of keratinocytes often present from birth and distributed
      along the lines of Blaschko. Histologically the lesions show features of epidermolytic
      hyperkeratosis with perinuclear vacuolization of keratinocytes of the upper
      epidermis with coarse keratohyaline granules. There is no extra-cutaneous involvement.
      Affected individuals are at risk of parenting a child with bullous ichthyosiform
      erythroderma.
