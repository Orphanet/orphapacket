  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by infantile or childhood onset
      of abnormal growth of hyalinized fibrous tissue giving rise to multiple cutaneous
      nodules and/or pearly papules predominantly affecting the scalp ears neck face
      hands and feet. Involvement of other organs results in gingival hyperplasia
      osteolytic bone lesions and joint contractures. Some patients exhibit visceral
      involvement with intractable diarrhea increased susceptibility to infections
      and severe failure to thrive.
