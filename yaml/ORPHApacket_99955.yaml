  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B1 (CMT4B1) is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease type 4 characterized by an early childhood-onset of severe demyelinating
      sensorimotor neuropathy various degrees of complex myelin outfoldings seen on
      peripheral nerve biopsy very slow and often undetectable nerve conduction velocities
      and the typical CMT phenotype (i.e. distal muscle weakness and atrophy sensory
      loss and frequent pes cavus). Other reported features include facial weakness
      vocal cord paresis respiratory difficulties and skeletal deformities (e.g. chest
      deformities claw hands pes equinovarus).
