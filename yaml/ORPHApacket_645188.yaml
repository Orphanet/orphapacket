  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare closed dysraphism with stalk characterized by a dorsal midline
      dermal sinus tract lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium extending
      to the the intrathecal space. Other components such as hair follicles and shafts
      mesenchymal derivatives (blood vessels and fibrous tissue) and occasionally
      nerve fibers can be observed. Inflamed granulation tissue containing mixed neutrophils
      plasma cells lymphocytes and histiocytes is consistently found in the tract.
      It can also be associated with an intradural dermoid cyst. This malformation
      is at risk to cause intrathecal infections (meningitis empyema) that justify
      a prophylactic surgery.
