  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial patent arterial duct is a rare genetic non-syndromic congenital
      anomaly of the great arteries characterized by the presence of an isolated patent
      arterial duct (PDA) (i.e. failure of closure of ductus arteriosis after birth)
      in several members of the same family. Clinical presentation is similar to the
      sporadic form and may range from neonatal-onset tachypnea diaphoresis and failure
      to thrive to adult-onset atrial arrhythmia signs and symptoms of heart failure
      and cyanosis limited to the lower extremities.
