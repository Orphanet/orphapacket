  TextSection:
    Contents: GNE myopathy is a rare autosomal recessive distal myopathy characterized
      by early adult-onset slowly to moderately progressive distal muscle weakness
      that preferentially affects the tibialis anterior muscle and that usually spares
      the quadriceps femoris. Muscle biopsy reveals presence of rimmed vacuoles.
