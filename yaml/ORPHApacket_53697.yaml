  TextSection:
    Contents: Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia (GDD) is a bone dysplasia characterized by
      bone fragility frequent bone fractures at a young age cemento-osseous lesions
      of the jaw bones bowing of tubular bones (tibia and fibula) and diaphyseal sclerosis
      of long bones associated with generalized osteopenia. GD follows an autosomal
      dominant mode of transmission.
