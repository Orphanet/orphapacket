  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare maternal disease-related embryofetopathy characterized by variable
      developmental anomalies of the fetus due to teratogenic effect of elevated maternal
      body temperature (resulting from febrile illness or hot environment exposure).
      Reported developmental anomalies include neural tube defects (spina bifida ecephalocele
      anencephaly) cardiac defects (transposition of great vessels) urogenital defects
      (hypospadias) abdominal wall defects cleft lip/palate eye defects (cataract
      coloboma) or various minor anomalies (e.g. bifid uvula preauricular pit or tag).
      Consensus regarding cause-effect relationship has not been reached.
