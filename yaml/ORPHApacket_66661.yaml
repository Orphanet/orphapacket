  TextSection:
    Contents: Mast cell sarcoma is a rare neoplastic disease characterized by locally
      destructive sarcoma-like growth of a solitary mass composed of atypical mast
      cells and without systemic involvement. It can affect any organ and the symptoms
      depend on the location. Cells are medium to large pleomorphic or epithelioid
      with oval bilobed or multilobulated nuclei sometimes prominent multinucleated
      giant cells. The disease closely resembles other neoplasms and may share associated
      markers however the tumor is positive for mast cell tryptase.
