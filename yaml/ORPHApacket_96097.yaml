  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal trisomy 5q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from
      a partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 5 characterized by short
      stature moderate intellectual disability and craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly
      flat facies large low-set dysplastic ears down-slanted almond-shaped palpebral
      fissures hypertelorism epicanthal folds small nose long philtrum small mouth
      with thin upper lip and micrognathia). Patients also frequently present speech
      and cognitive delay cardiac (ventriculomegaly ventricular septum defect) and
      skeletal abnormalities (craniosynostosis radial agenesis ulnar hypoplasia brachydactyly)
      and genital malformations (hypospadias cryptorchidism).
