  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acromelic dysplasia characterized by abnormal and/or delayed
      ossification of bones primarily in the hands and feet (that may lead to brachydactyly
      camptodactyly and clinodactyly) severe limb deformities joint contractures pigmentary
      skin lesions on the face and scalp and digital fibromatosis of the fingers and
      toes which appear a few months after birth. While the skeletal manifestations
      primarily affect the hands and feet more generalized bone involvement including
      mesomelic bowing and/or shortening of the arms and legs have also been reported.
      Some patients may also present with craniofacial dysmorphism including midface
      hypoplasia hypertelorism ptosis coloboma of the iris and eyelids low-set ears
      depressed nasal bridge and multiple hypertrophic frenula. Additional clinical
      features may include short stature short broad thorax scoliosis atrial septal
      defect and ventricular septal hypertrophy pulmonary artery stenosis and anal
      stenosis.
