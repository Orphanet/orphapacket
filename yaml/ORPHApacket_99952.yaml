  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4F (CMT4F) is a severe demyelinating
      subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 characterized by the childhood
      onset of a slowly-progressing typical CMT phenotype (i.e. distal muscle weakness
      and atrophy as well as pes cavus) that presents severe sensory loss (frequently
      with sensory ataxia) moderately to severely reduced motor nerve conduction velocities
      and almost invariable absence of sensory nerve action potentials and delayed
      motor milestones.
