  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect Epstein-Barr virus infection
      and neoplasia is a rare combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized
      by recurrent sinopulmonary and viral infections persistent elevated Epstein-Barr
      virus (EBV) viremia and increased susceptibility to EBV-associated B-cell lymphoproliferative
      disorders. Immunological analyses show normal lymphocyte count or mild to moderate
      lymphopenia inverted CD4:CD8 T-cell ratio and hypogammaglobulinemias.
