  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) characterized
      by predisposition to a wide variety of cancers including neoplasms of the digestive
      tract urinary tract endometrium ovary brain and prostate as well as sebaceous
      skin tumors. LS-associated tumors are typically characterized by the presence
      of microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of expression of MMR proteins in
      tumor tissue.
