  TextSection:
    Contents: Secondary syringomyelia is a rare medullar disease defined as a development
      of a fluid-filled cavity or syrinx within the spinal cord due to blockage of
      CSF circulation (e.g. due to basal archnoiditis meningeal carcinomatosis various
      mass lesions) spinal cord injury (e.g. due to trauma radiation necrosis hemorrhage
      spinal abscess) spinal dysraphism or intramedullary tumours. It presents with
      neuropathic pain numbness muscular weakness changes in tone or spasticity or
      autonomic changes (hyperhidrosis heart rate or blood pressure instability).
      Selective loss of pain and temperature with relative preservation of dorsal
      column function (touch and pressure) are classic findings.
