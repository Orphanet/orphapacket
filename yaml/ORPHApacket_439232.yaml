  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare nonhereditary systemic amyloidosis characterized by slowly progressive
      renal dysfunction increased serum creatinine mostly normal urine analysis with
      no significant proteinuria and associated heart disease. Cardiac involvement
      presents as hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy left ventricular outflow
      tract obstruction coronary artery disease and conduction system abnormalities.
      Histology reveals medullar amyloid deposits renal tubular atrophy interstitial
      fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis.
