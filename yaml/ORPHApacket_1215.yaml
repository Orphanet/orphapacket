  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuro-ophthalmological disease associating the typical optic
      atrophy with other extra-ocular manifestations such as sensorineural deafness
      myopathy chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia ataxia and peripheral
      neuropathy. More rarely other manifestations have been associated with this
      condition such as spastic paraplegia or multiple-sclerosis like illness.
