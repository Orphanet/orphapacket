  TextSection:
    Contents: Cutaneous larva migrans is a rare parasitic disease characterized by
      single or multiple linear or serpiginous erythematous slightly elevated cutaneous
      tracks caused by the larval migration of various nematode species. Tracks are
      variable in length generally a few millimeters wide and are frequently located
      on the feet (although any area of the body is possible). Patients typically
      present with severe intractable pruritus which in some cases may cause impaired
      concentration loss of sleep and mood disturbances.
