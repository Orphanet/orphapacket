  TextSection:
    Contents: Heterotaxia (coming from the Greek 'heteros' meaning different and 'taxis'
      meaning arrangement) is the right/left transposition of thoracic and/or abdominal
      organs. It encompasses a wide variety of disorders since there are multiple
      possibilities of right/left reversals which may be complete (<i>situs inversus
      totalis</i> or <i>situs inversus</i> <i>i.e.</i> all the organs normally found
      on the right are on the left and vice versa) or partial (incomplete <i>situs
      inversus</i> <i>i.e.</i> a limited number of organs are inversed - or <i>situs
      inversus ambiguous</i> <i>i.e.</i> a normally lateral organ is centrally located).
