  TextSection:
    Contents: Vasculitis represents a clinically heterogenous group of diseases of
      multifactorial etiology characterized by inflammation of either large-sized
      vessels (large-vessel vasculitis e.g. Giant-cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis)
      medium-sized vessels (medium-vessel vasculitis e.g. polyarteritis nodosa and
      Kawasaki disease) or small-sized vessels (small-vessel vasculitis e.g. granulomatosis
      with polyangiitis microscopic polyangiitis immunoglobulin A vasculitis and cutaneous
      leukocytoclastic angiitis). Vasculitis occurs at any age may be acute or chronic
      and manifests with general symptoms such as fever weight loss and fatigue as
      well as more specific clinical signs depending on the type of vessels and organs
      affected. The degree of severity is variable ranging from life or sight threatening
      disease (e.g. Behçet disease) to relatively minor skin disease.
