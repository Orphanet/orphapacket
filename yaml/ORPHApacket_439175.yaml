  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic condition characterized by focal cerebral ischemia
      and infarction due to blockage of a brain artery with subsequent impairment
      of blood supply and oxygenation of brain tissue. Most children present with
      hemiparesis with or without facial palsy at stroke onset. In addition compared
      to adults children more often suffer strokes in the posterior circulation leading
      to ataxia or oculomotor disturbance. Likewise aphasia is more frequent in pediatric
      patients. Other signs and symptoms include seizures headache vomiting and alterations
      in the level of consciousness. Children under one year of age are more likely
      to present with seizures and altered level of consciousness while older children
      more often show focal neurological deficits.
