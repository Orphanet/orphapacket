  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability syndrome characterized
      by mild to severe global developmental delay and intellectual disability delayed
      or absent speech and walking and bilateral sensorineural deafness. Severity
      of the symptoms are variable. Patients may manifest with profound hypotonia
      severe feeding difficulties and secretory dysfuntion. Autistic features spasticity
      mild and non-specific dysmorphic features and cardiac defects were reported
      in some patients.
