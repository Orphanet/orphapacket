  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare epithelial carcinoma arising either in the gallbladder itself
      or from the epithelium lining the extrahepatic biliary tree cystic duct and/or
      peribiliary gland characterized by nonspecific symptoms such as abdominal pain
      jaundice and vomiting and sometimes mimicking benign biliary diseases. Chronic
      biliary epithelial inflammation (e.g. primary sclerosing cholangitis cholelithiasis
      choledocholithiasis liver fluke infestation) is a major risk factor.
