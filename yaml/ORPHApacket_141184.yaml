  TextSection:
    Contents: Rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH) are a distinctive type
      of congenital hemangioma that are fully formed <i>in utero</i> and differ from
      non-involuting congenital haemangiomas (NICH; see this term) mainly because
      they undergo rapid postnatal involution.
