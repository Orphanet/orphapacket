  TextSection:
    Contents: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy/atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD/atypical
      NAD) is a type of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA; see
      this term) characterized by psychomotor delay and regression increasing neurological
      involvement with symmetrical pyramidal tract signs and spastic tetraplegia.
      INAD may be classic or atypical and patients present with symptoms anywhere
      along a continuum between the two.
