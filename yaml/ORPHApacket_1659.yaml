  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare leukodystrophy characterized by congenital thickened wrinkled
      skin showing loss of elasticity in combination with childhood onset of rapidly
      progressive generalized cognitive and motor impairment quickly resulting in
      a vegetative state and early death. Neuropathologic examination reveals neuroaxonal
      leukodystrophy with numerous neuroaxonal spheroids and diffuse loss of axons
      and myelin sheaths.
