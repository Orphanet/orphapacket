  TextSection:
    Contents: Thumb deformity-alopecia-pigmentation anomaly syndrome is a rare genetic
      congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by short stature sparse
      scalp hair hypoplastic proximally-placed thumbs and skin hyperpigmentation with
      areas of 'raindrop' depigmentation. Presence of a single upper central incisor
      has also been reported. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
