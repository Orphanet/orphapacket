  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 21 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease characterized by axial hypotonia with limb hypertonia developmental
      delay hyperlactatemia central nervous system anomalies visible on magnetic resonance
      imaging (e.g. corpus callosum hypoplasia lesions of the globus pallidus) and
      multiple deficiency of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in muscle
      tissue but not in fibroblasts or liver.
