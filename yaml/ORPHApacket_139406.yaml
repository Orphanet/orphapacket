  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by severe neurologic symptoms
      including grand mal seizures massive myoclonic bursts hypotonia abnormal ocular
      movements dystonia and hepatosplenomegaly. Symptoms appear at or shortly after
      birth and follow a rapidly progressive fatal course. All patients manifest with
      lipid accumulation due to lysosomal dysfunction with histologic findings of
      accumulation of various sphingolipids (e.g. glucosylceramide ceramide sulfatides
      globotriaosylceramide).
