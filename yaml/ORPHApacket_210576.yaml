  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital temporomandibular joint ankylosis is a rare maxillofacial
      disorder characterized by significant reduction in mouth opening (i.e. from
      a few millimeters to a few centimeters) in the absence of acquired factors (e.g.
      trauma infection) contributing to the ankylosis. It is associated with variable
      degrees of facial dysmorphism (i.e. lateral deviation of the mandible and chin
      lower facial asymmetry retrognathia micrognathia dental malocclusion) and patients
      typically present with feeding and breathing difficulties. Developmental delay
      hypotonia seizures and additional dysmorphic features (e.g. pectus excavatum
      low-set ears hypoplastic alae nasi) have also been reported.
