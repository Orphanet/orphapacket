  TextSection:
    Contents: Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is a very rare Epstein-Barr virus
      (EBV)-driven lymphoproliferative disease most commonly occurring in adults (in
      the fourth to sixth decade of life) and commonly affecting the lungs (with presentations
      varying from small bilateral pulmonary nodules to large necrotic and sometimes
      cavitating lesions) skin central nervous system and kidneys but only very rarely
      affecting the lymph nodes and spleen. The symptoms associated with LYG depend
      on the site of disease involvement but mainly include cough dyspnea or chest
      pain (in those with pulmonary involvement) and constitutional symptoms such
      as weight loss and fever.
