  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vulvovaginal tumor characterized by intraepithelial neoplastic
      proliferation of the vulvar epithelium histologically presenting proliferation
      of atypical basal cells with basal layer involvement enlarged nuclei hyperchromasia
      pleomorphic cells and increased numbers of mitotic figures. Patients are frequently
      asymptomatic although vulvar pruritus/pain/burning dysuria and/or dyspareunia
      may be associated. Concurrent anogenital involvement is frequent. Two subtypes
      usual type VIN (uVIN) and differentiated type VIN (dVIN) exist with uVIN typically
      being associated with HPV infection and presenting multifocal elevated lesions
      around the introitus and/or labia majora and dVIN being related to chronic inflammation
      and lesions consisting of poorly demarcated pink or white plaques that are often
      associated with lichen sclerosus or lichen planus. Diffusely positive p16 immunohistochemistry
      and high Ki-67 proliferation index in uVIN futher differentiates this subtype
      from dVIN this latter being consistently negative for p16 while presenting p53
      positivity.
