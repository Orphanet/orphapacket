  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare odontogenic tumor characterized by an unilocular or multilocular
      cyst most commonly located in the posterior body and lower ramus of the mandible
      often surrounding the crown of the third molar. Histopathologically the lesion
      shows a lining of parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium with palisading
      hyperchromatic basal cells. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with local
      infection and/or signs and symptoms of mass effect. Recurrence is rare after
      complete surgical removal. Some patients have multiple cysts (metachronous or
      synchronous) especially in the context of nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
      (Gorlin syndrome).
