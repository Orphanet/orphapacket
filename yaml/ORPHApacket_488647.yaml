  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by adult
      onset of hematologic malignancies mainly affecting the myeloid lineage (such
      as myelodysplastic syndrome and/or acute myeloid leukemia) less frequently lymphoid
      malignancies. Some patients have been reported to develop granulomatous or immune
      disorders (including sarcoidosis systemic lupus erythematosus asthma eczema
      or juvenile arthritis) before or in the absence of hematologic malignancies.
