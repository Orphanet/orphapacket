  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by extrapyramidal symptoms
      (rigidity tremor bradykinesia) and dementia typically beginning in the fifth
      or sixth decade of life and progressing to a vegetative state with pelvicrural
      flexion contractures within few years. Oculomotor signs olfactory dysfunction
      and autonomic disturbances may also be observed. Neuropathological hallmarks
      are frontotemporally accentuated cerebral atrophy as well as neurofibrillary
      tangles and neuronal loss in a characteristic distribution in cortical and subcortical
      regions. The disease is endemic to the Pacific island of Guam.
