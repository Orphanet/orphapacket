  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare renal disease characterized by thrombotic microangiopathy developing
      <i>de novo</i> in kidney transplant recipients with no evidence of occurrence
      of the disease prior to transplantation. Precipitating factors include antibody-mediated
      rejection immunosuppressive medication viral infections and genetic abnormalities
      in the complement cascade among others. The condition most commonly occurs within
      the first 3-6 months post-transplantation. Clinical presentation is highly variable
      and ranges from a limited form confined to the kidney with relatively good prognosis
      to a systemic variant consisting of the classic triad of thrombocytopenia microangiopathic
      hemolytic anemia and acute kidney injury.
