    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by a clinical picture of variable
      severity associating sensorineural hearing impairment with ovarian dysgenesis
      in females sometimes progressive neurologic disorder and exceptionally renal
      disease. The disease affects both sexes but hypogonadism is not a feature in
