  TextSection:
    Contents: Keratolytic winter erythema is a rare epidermal disease characterized
      by recurrent centrifugal palmoplantar peeling and erythema presenting seasonal
      variation (cold weather). Skin lesions may spread to the dorsum of hands and
      feet and to the interdigital spaces. Lower legs knees and thighs may also be
      involved. Episodes may be preceded by itch and hyperhidrosis. Skin biopsy reveals
      an epidermal spongiosis with clefting in the stratum corneum followed by regrowth.
      Keratolytic winter erythema follows an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.
