  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by
      infancy onset of severe inflammatory bowel disease with life-threatening diarrhea
      and failure to thrive oral aphthous ulcers and recurrent severe upper and lower
      respiratory tract infections with finger clubbing. Laboratory examination reveals
      increased IgE and decreased IgG levels as well as reduced numbers of circulating
      CD19+ B-cells including IgM+ naive and class-switched IgG memory B-cells with
      a concomitant increase in transitional B-cells while T-cell numbers and function
      are normal.
