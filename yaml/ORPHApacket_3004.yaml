  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterized by mirror polydactyly vertebral hypersegmentation
      and severe congenital limb deficiencies. Duodenal atresia and absent thymus
      were also reported. So far it has been described in four unrelated infants identified
      through a congenital malformation screening program carried out in Spain. The
      prevalence was estimated at around 1 in 330,000. The etiology is unknown but
      it was suggested that the syndrome is caused by defective expression of a developmental
      control gene.
