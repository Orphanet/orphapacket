    Contents: 'Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked leukodystrophy characterized
      by developmental delay nystagmus hypotonia spasticity and variable intellectual
      deficit. It is classified into three sub-forms based on the age of onset and
      severity: connatal transitional and classic PMD (see these terms).'
