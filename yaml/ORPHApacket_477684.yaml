  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a highly variable phenotype which may present as exercise intolerance with
      prominent exertional dyspnea progressive muscle weakness spasticity and neuropathy
      but without cognitive impairment or cardiac involvement or as global developmental
      delay growth retardation hypotonia and spasticity. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
      optic atrophy seizures and dysmorphic facial features have also been reported
      in the more severe phenotype. Serum lactate may be elevated and muscle biopsy
      shows myopathic features and variably decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory
      chain complexes.
