  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of type 2 von Willebrand disease characterized by a bleeding
      disorder associated with a marked decrease in the affinity of the Willebrand
      factor (VWF) for factor VIII (FVIII). Abnormal bleeding manifestations are less
      frequent in this VWD subtype than in other forms of the disease. The disease
      manifests mainly as soft tissue bleeding (haematoma post-operative bleeding
      etc.).
