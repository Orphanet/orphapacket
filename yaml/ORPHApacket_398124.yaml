  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by cutaneous lesions
      hepatic dysfunction hematological abnormalities and/or cardiac arrhythmia and
      caused by transplacental passage of maternal SS-A and SS-B autoantibodies. The
      most typical cutaneous manifestation is a macular annular erythema affecting
      the head but also trunk and extremities. Other reversible features include anemia
      neutropenia thrombocytopenia and elevation of liver parameters with hepatomegaly.
      The most severe presentation of the disease is irreversible congenital total
      atrioventricular block.
