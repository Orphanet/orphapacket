  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cranial neuralgia characterized by paroxysmal usually unilateral
      stabbing pain within the sensory distributions of the auricular and pharyngeal
      branches of the glossopharyngeal and sometimes the vagus nerve (i. e. the posterior
      part of the tongue the tonsillar fossa oropharynx larynx angle of the mandible
      and/or ear). The attacks last seconds to minutes with intervals between the
      paroxysms ranging from a few minutes to a few hours and appear in clusters lasting
      weeks to months again with irregular intervals in between. Pain attacks are
      usually triggered by a specific stimulus but may also occur spontaneously. The
      condition can sometimes be associated with bradycardia syncope seizures and
      even asystole and is then termed vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia.
