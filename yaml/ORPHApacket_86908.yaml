  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome characterized by hemiplegia
      occurring in children (typically under the age of 4) following prolonged focal
      seizures often febrile in nature. The condition progresses through three stages:
      initial prolonged seizures subsequent hemiplegia (weakness or paralysis on one
      side of the body) and eventual epilepsy following a latent period. The condition
      may be idiopathic or associated with structural infectious traumatic or degenerative
      brain abnormalities. Patients present with acute unilateral brain swelling followed
      by cerebral hemiatrophy. Inflammation genetic predisposition and prolonged seizure
      activity may play a role in the disease development/progression.'
