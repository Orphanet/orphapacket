  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute encephalopathy with inflammation-mediated status epilepticus
      characterized by infancy-onset of refractory unilateral mainly clonic status
      epilepticus during or shortly after a febrile episode without evidence of central
      nervous system infection followed by permanent or transient hemiplegia with
      a minimum duration of one week. The majority of children develop pharmaco-resistant
      epilepsy a few months later. Brain imaging shows edematous swelling of the affected
      hemisphere at the time of the initial status followed by hemiatrophy that does
      not correlate with any vascular territory.
