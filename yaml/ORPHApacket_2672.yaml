  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by infantile or childhood
      onset of recurrent acute encephalopathic episodes with cerebellar and extrapyramidal
      involvement following febrile illnesses. During the episodes patients typically
      show sudden onset of truncal ataxia occasionally accompanied by lethargy and
      impairment of speech as well as choreic and athetoid movements seizures loss
      of deep tendon reflexes and presence of pathological reflexes. Episodes last
      from day to weeks and may leave residual symptoms such as speech impairment
      and poor coordination. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1983.
