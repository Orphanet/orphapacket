  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial multiple meningioma is a rare benign neoplasm of the central
      nervous system characterized by the development of multiple or rarely solitary
      meningiomas in two or more blood relatives without other apparent syndromic
      manifestations. Depending on the localization growth rate and size of the tumors
      patients can present with subtle gradually worsening or abrupt and severe neurological
      compromise or can be completely asymptomatic.
