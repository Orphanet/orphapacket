  TextSection:
    Contents: A severe form of hemophilia A characterized by a large deficiency of
      factor VIII (biological activity <1 IU/dL) leading to frequent spontaneous hemorrhage
      and abnormal bleeding as a result of minor injuries or following trauma surgery
      or tooth extraction. It primarily affects males but may also be observed in
      female carriers of disease-causing mutations.
