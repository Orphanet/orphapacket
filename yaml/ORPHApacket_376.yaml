  TextSection:
    Contents: Gordon syndrome also known as distal arthrogryposis type 3 is an extremely
      rare multiple congenital malformation syndrome characterized by congenital contractures
      of hand and feet with variable degrees of severity of camptodactyly clubfoot
      and less frequently cleft palate. Intelligence is normal but in some cases additional
      abnormalities such as short stature kyphoscoliosis ptosis micrognathia and cryptorchidism
      may also be present. Gordon syndrome Marden-Walker syndrome and arthrogryposis
      with oculomotor limitation and electroretinal anomalies clinically and genetically
      overlap and could represent variable expressions of the same condition.
