  TextSection:
    Contents: Multilocular cystic renal neoplasm of low malignant potential is a rare
      subtype of clear cell renal cell carcinoma with distinct pathological features
      of cysts lined by occasionally flattened cuboidal clear cells and septa containing
      aggregates of epithelial cells with clear cytoplasm and excellent prognosis.
      The tumor usually presents as an asymptomatic unilateral solitary lesion macroscopically
      consisting of numerous fluid-filled septated cysts of variable size. Rarely
      the symptoms typically associated with renal tumors (flank pain hematuria palpable
      mass) may be present.
