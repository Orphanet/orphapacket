  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability Birk-Barel type is a rare genetic syndromic
      intellectual disability characterized by congenital central hypotonia developmental
      delay moderate to severe intellectual disability and subtle dysmorphic features
      which evolve over time (dolichocephaly myopathic facies ptosis short and broad
      philtrum tented upper lip vermillion palatal anomalies mild micro- and/or retrognathia).
      Patients present reduced facial movements lethargy weak cry transient neonatal
      hypoglycemia severe feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. Dysphagia particularly
      of solid food asthenic body build joint contractures and scoliosis are additional
      features.
