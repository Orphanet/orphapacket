  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular tumor characterized by a poorly circumscribed infiltrative
      nodular lesion with vascular differentiation centered in the dermis and subcutis.
      The tumor is composed of histologically benign intermediate and malignant components.
      Typical is an admixture of different components which include epithelioid and
      retiform hemangioendothelioma spindle cell hemangioma angiosarcoma-like areas
      and benign vascular lesions. Predilection sites are the distal extremities.
      Many patients have a history of lymphedema. Local recurrence is frequent while
      metastasis is rare.
