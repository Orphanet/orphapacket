  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare viral disease characterized by fever malaise lymphadenopathy
      and a maculopapular exanthema spreading from the site of infection to other
      regions of the body. The skin lesions eventually dry out and may leave behind
      scars. The most relevant orthopox species for human disease after the eradication
      of the variola virus which was responsible for smallpox are the monkeypox virus
      and the cowpox virus. Infections with these viruses typically take a benign
      course.
