    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis that is characterized
      by growth dysregulation with overgrowth of the brain and multiple somatic tissues
      with capillary skin malformations megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly
      (HMEG) cortical brain abnormalities (in particular polymicrogyria) typical facial
      dysmorphisms abnormalities of somatic growth with asymmetry of the body and
