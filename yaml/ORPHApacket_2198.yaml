  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by thickening of the skin on palms
      and soles restricted to areas of weight bearing and/or friction (focal non-epidermolytic
      palmoplantar keratoderma) and oral and esophageal leukokeratosis associated
      with a very high lifetime risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the
      esophagus. The skin lesions appear in childhood and can be complicated by fissuring
      and infection.
