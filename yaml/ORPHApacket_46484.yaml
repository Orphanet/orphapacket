    Contents: 'Oligodendrogliomas are cerebral tumors that are differentiated from
      other gliomas on the basis of their unique genetic characteristics and better
      response to chemotherapy. These tumors are classified according to their grade
      (low grade oligodendrogliomas: grade II of the WHO classification and anaplastic
      oligodendrogliomas: grade III of the WHO classification) and according to their
      pure or mixed histology (oligoastrocytomas).'
