  TextSection:
    Contents: Vocal cord and pharyngeal distal myopathy (VCPDM) is a rare autosomal
      dominant distal myopathy characterized by adult onset of muscle weakness in
      the feet and hands (slowly progressing to involve proximal limb muscles) combined
      with vocal or swallowing dysfunction and frequent respiratory muscle involvement
      in later stages. Normal to mildly elevated creatine kinase (CK) serum levels
      and rimmed-vacuolated dystrophic muscle fiber changes are associated laboratory
      and pathologic findings.
