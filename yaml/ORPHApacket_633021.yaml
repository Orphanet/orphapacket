  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of SLC12A2-related developmental delay-intellectual disability-sensorineural
      deafness syndrome characterized by profound global developmental delay impaired
      intellectual development absent speech sensorineural hearing loss and hypotonia
      (present at birth). Patients have poor overall growth with severe feeding difficulties
      associated with gastrointestinal anomalies (including gastroesophageal reflux
      midgut malrotation). Secretory dysfunction (including tear sweat and saliva
      production) causing dry mouth and recurrent bronchial mucus plugging are commonly
      observed. Differing from other form of the syndrome these patients are often
      present with mild and non specific dysmorphic features (narrow forehead oblong
      face low-set ears wide mouth mandibular prognathia) and have multiple malformations
      (gastrointestinal brain choanal).
