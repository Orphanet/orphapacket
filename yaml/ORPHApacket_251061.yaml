  TextSection:
    Contents: 7q31 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly characterized
      by speech and language disorder predominantly presenting as an apraxia of speech
      sometimes associated with oral motor dyspraxia dysarthria receptive and expressive
      language disorder and hearing loss. Individuals with larger deletions in this
      region have also been reported to display intellectual disability and autism.
