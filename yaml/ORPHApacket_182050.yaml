  TextSection:
    Contents: MYH9-related disease (MYH9-RD) is an inherited giant platelet disorder
      with a complex phenotype characterized by congenital thrombocytopenia and possible
      subsequent manifestations of sensorineural hearing loss presenile cataracts
      elevation of liver enzymes and/or progressive nephropathy often leading to end-stage
      renal disease (ESRD). Epstein syndrome Fechtner syndrome May-Hegglin anomaly
      and Sebastian syndrome previously described as distinct disorders represent
      some of the different clinical presentations of MYH9-RD.
