  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation is a rare genetic skin
      pigmentation anomaly disorder characterized by progressive diffuse partly blotchy
      hyperpigmented lesions that are intermixed with multiple café-au-lait spots
      hypopigmented maculae and lentigines and are located on the face neck trunk
      and limbs as well as frequently the palms soles and oral mucosa. Dispigmentation
      pattern can range from well isolated café-au-lait/hypopigmented patches on a
      background of normal-appearing skin to confetti-like or mottled appearance.
