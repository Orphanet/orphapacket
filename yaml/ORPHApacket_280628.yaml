    Contents: "Familial progressive hyper- and hypopigmentation is a rare genetic\
      \ skin pigmentation anomaly disorder characterized by progressive diffuse partly\
      \ blotchy hyperpigmented lesions that are intermixed with multiple caf\xE9-au-lait\
      \ spots hypopigmented maculae and lentigines and are located on the face neck\
      \ trunk and limbs as well as frequently the palms soles and oral mucosa. Dispigmentation\
      \ pattern can range from well isolated caf\xE9-au-lait/hypopigmented patches\
      \ on a background of normal-appearing skin to confetti-like or mottled appearance."
