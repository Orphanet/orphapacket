  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic skeletal muscle disease characterized by abnormal chimeric
      aggregates of desmin and other cytoskeletal proteins and granulofilamentous
      material at the ultrastructural level in muscle biopsies and variable clinical
      myopathological features age of disease onset and rate of disease progression.
      Patients present with bilateral skeletal muscle weakness that starts in distal
      leg muscles and spreads proximally sometimes involving trunk neck flexors and
      facial muscles and often cardiomyopathy manifested by conduction blocks arrhythmias
      chronic heart failure and sometimes tachyarrhythmia. Weakness eventually leads
      to wheelchair dependence. Respiratory insufficiency can be a major cause of
      disability and death beginning with nocturnal hypoventilation with oxygen desaturation
      and progressing to daytime respiratory failure.
