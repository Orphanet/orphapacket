  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated glycerol kinase deficiency (GKD) is a very rare X-linked disorder
      of glycerol metabolism characterized biochemically by elevated plasma and urine
      glycerol levels and clinically by variable neurometabolic manifestations depending
      on the age of onset and varying from a life-threatening childhood metabolic
      crisis to an asymptomatic adult form (infantile GKD juvenile GKD and adult GKD
      (see these terms)).
