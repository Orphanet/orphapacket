  TextSection:
    Contents: Pituitary dermoid and epidermoid cysts is a rare acquired pituitary
      hormone deficiency characterized by the presence of rare benign tumor in the
      sellar region. Clinical presentation is either acute or insidious and is variable
      according to the cyst location size and potential rupture. Most commonly patients
      present with headache visual disturbances and pituitary dysfunction.
