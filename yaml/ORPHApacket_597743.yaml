  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by microcephaly severe global developmental delay and intellectual disability
      hypotonia respiratory insufficiency failure to thrive and congenital anomalies
      affecting the skeleton eyes and several organ systems. Seizures and hearing
      loss are sometimes observed. Independent ambulation and meaningful speech are
      not attained. Common dysmorphic facial features include small forehead biparietal
      narrowing flat face hypertelorism arched eyebrows short upslanting palpebral
      fissures wide nasal bridge small upturned nose forward facing ears and micrognathia.
      Brain imaging shows structural abnormalities in all patients.
