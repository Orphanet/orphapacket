  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by cerebellar ataxia cytopenias
      and predisposition to bone marrow failure and myeloid leukaemia. Neurologic
      features variably include slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia or balance impairment
      with cerebellar atrophy and periventricular white matter T2 hyperintensities
      in brain MRI horizontal and vertical nystagmus dysmetria dysarthria pyramidal
      tract signs and reduced nerve conduction velocity. Hematological abnormalities
      are variable and may be intermittent and include cytopenias of all cell lineages
      immunodeficiency myelodysplasia and acute myeloid leukemia.
