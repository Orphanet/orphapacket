  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic genetic cataract characterized by the association of
      congenital cataract and microcornea without any other systemic anomaly or dysmorphism.
      Clinical findings include a decreased corneal diameter (inferior to 10 mm) in
      both meridians in an otherwise normal eye and an inherited cataract which is
      mostly bilateral posterior polar with opacification in the lens periphery that
      progresses to form a total cataract after visual maturity has been achieved.
      Association with other ocular manifestations including myopia iris coloboma
      sclerocornea and Peters anomaly may be observed.
