  TextSection:
    Contents: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal
      neoplasm of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract typically presenting in adults over
      the age of 40 (mean age 63) and only rarely in children in various regions of
      the GI tract most commonly the stomach or small intestine but also less commonly
      in the esophagus appendix rectum and colon. GISTs can be asymptomatic or present
      with various non-specific signs depending on the location and size of tumor
      such as loss of appetite anemia weight loss fatigue abdominal discomfort or
      fullness nausea vomiting as well as an abdominal mass blood in stool and intestinal
      obstruction. GISTs can also be seen in familial syndromes such as Carney triad
      and neurofibromatosis type 1.
