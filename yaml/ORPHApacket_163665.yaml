  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia
      characterized by short trunk dwarfism progressive involvement of the spine and
      epiphyses and mild-to-moderate intellectual deficiency. Typical radiographic
      features include platyspondyly abnormal lumbar vertebral bodies with anterior
      tongue-like protrusions and the presence of degenerative large joint changes
      in the shoulder hip and knee joints manifesting as narrowing of the joint spaces
      and irregularities of the articulate surfaces. Dens epistropheus may be absent.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1987.
