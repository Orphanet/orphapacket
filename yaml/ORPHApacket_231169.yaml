  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ciliopathy characterized by profound congenital deafness retinitis
      pigmentosa and vestibular dysfunction. Retinitis pigmentosa results in visual
      loss and generally manifests as night blindness progressively constricted visual
      fields and impaired visual acuity. Vestibular dysfunction a defining feature
      of this form manifests as delayed motor development with affected infants taking
      longer to sit independently and to walk. Later on vestibular dysfunction results
      in difficulty with activities requiring balance.
