  TextSection:
    Contents: Fibulo-ulnar hypoplasia-renal anomalies syndrome is characterized by
      fibuloulnar dysostosis with renal anomalies. It has been described in two sibs
      born to nonconsanguinous parents. The syndrome is lethal at birth (respiratory
      failure). Clinical manifestations include ear and facial anomalies (including
      micrognathia) symmetrical shortness of long bones fibular agenesis and hypoplastic
      ulna oligosyndactyly congenital heart defects and cystic or hypoplastic kidney.
      It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.
