  TextSection:
    Contents: Sialidosis type 2 (ST-2) is a rare lysosomal storage disease and the
      severe early onset form of sialidosis (see this term) characterized by a progressively
      severe mucopolysaccharidosis-like phenotype (coarse facies dysostosis multiplex
      hepatosplenomegaly) macular cherry-red spots as well as psychomotor and developmental
      delay. ST-2 displays a broad spectrum of clinical severity with antenatal/congenital
      infantile and juvenile presentations.
