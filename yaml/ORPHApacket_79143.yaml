  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated congenital anonychia is characterized by nail abnormalities
      ranging from onychodystrophy (dystrophic nails) to anonychia (absence of nails).
      Onychodystrophy-anonychia has been described in at least four generations of
      a family with male-to-male transmission suggesting autosomal dominant transmission.
      Anonychia has been described in approximately less than 20 cases; it is likely
      to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. Total anonychia congenita
      in which all the fingernails and toenails are absent may have an autosomal dominant
      inheritance pattern.
