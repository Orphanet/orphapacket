  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Pachydermoperiostosis (PDP) is a form of primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
      (see this term) a rare hereditary disorder and is characterized by digital clubbing
      pachydermia and subperiosteal new bone formation associated with pain polyarthritis
      <i>cutis verticis gyrata</i> seborrhea and hyperhidrosis. Three forms have been
      described: a complete form with pachydermia and periostitis an incomplete form
      with evidence of bone abnormalities but lacking pachydermia and a <i>forme frusta</i>
      with prominent pachydermia and minimal-to-absent skeletal changes.'
