  TextSection:
    Contents: Linear atrophoderma of Moulin (LAM) is characterized by mildly atrophic
      and hyperpigmented band-like lesions that follow the lines of Blaschko on the
      trunk or limbs. Since its initial description in 1992 less than 30 cases have
      been reported in the literature. Onset occurs during childhood or adolescence
      and the disease is non-progressive. There is no prior inflammation or subsequent
      scleroderma. The aetiology is unknown but as LAM follows the lines of Blaschko
      it has been suggested that the disease is caused by mosaicism of a predisposing
      gene.
