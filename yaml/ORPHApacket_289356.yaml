  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary non-gestational choriocarcinoma of ovary is a rare ovarian germ
      cell malignant tumor arising from primordial germ cells usually presenting with
      nausea vomiting abdominal pain menstrual irregularities and characterized by
      fast growth pattern metastasis to lung liver and brain and production of human
      chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). It is apparently chemoresistant and has a worse
      prognosis than gestational choriocarcinoma and hence should be distinguished
      from the latter by DNA polymorphism.
