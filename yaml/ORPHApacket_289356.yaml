  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary non-gestational choriocarcinoma of ovary is a rare ovarian germ
      cell malignant tumor (see this term) arising from primordial germ cells usually
      presenting with nausea vomiting abdominal pain menstrual irregularities and
      characterized by fast growth pattern metastasis to lung liver and brain and
      production of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). It is apparently chemoresistant
      and has a worse prognosis than gestational choriocarcinoma (see this term) and
      hence should be distinguished from the latter by DNA polymorphism.
