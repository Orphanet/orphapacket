  TextSection:
    Contents: A drug-related embryofetopathy that can occur when an embryo/fetus is
      exposed to the anticonvulsant drug phenytoin characterized by distinct craniofacial
      anomalies (hypertelorism and epicanthal folds short nose and deep nasal bridge
      malformed and low set ears short neck) as well as hypoplastic distal phalanges
      and underdevelopment of nails of fingers and toes prenatal and postnatal growth
      retardation and neurological impairment (at a 2-3 times higher risk than that
      of the general population) including cognitive deficits and motor developmental
      delay. Less commonly microcephaly ocular defects oral clefts umbilical and inguinal
      hernias hypospadias and cardiac anomalies have also been reported.
