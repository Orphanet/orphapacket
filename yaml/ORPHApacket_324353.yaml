  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital achiasma is a rare genetic non-syndromic cranial nerve and
      nuclear aplasia malformation characterized by the congenital absence of the
      optic chiasm resulting from the failure of the optic nerve fibers to cross over
      and decussate to the contralateral hemisphere leading to decreased vision strabismus
      and congenital nystagmus in infancy.
