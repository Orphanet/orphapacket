  TextSection:
    Contents: STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) is a rare
      genetic autoinflammatory disorder type I interferonopathy due to constitutive
      STING (STimulator of INterferon Genes) activation characterized by neonatal
      or infantile onset systemic inflammation and small vessel vasculopathy resulting
      in severe skin pulmonary and joint lesions. Patients present with intermittent
      low-grade fever recurrent cough and failure to thrive in association with progressive
      interstitial lung disease polyarthritis and violaceous scaling lesions on fingers
      toes nose cheeks and ears (which are exacerbated by cold exposure) that often
      progress to chronic acral ulceration necrosis and autoamputation.
