    Contents: A rare patterned dystrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium of progressive
      course characterized by the presence of a bilateral hyperpigmented reticular
      pattern resembling a fishnet with knots resulting in a slowly progressive loss
      of vision that often only becomes apparent in old age. This disorder is sometimes
