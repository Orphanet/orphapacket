  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare group of genetic primary immunodeficiencies characterized by
      impaired neutrophil maturation or function. Neutropenia ranges from mild to
      severe and may be cyclic isolated or syndromic. It is defined by a triad of
      severe infections diverse comorbidities and/or increased leukemic risk with
      severity and frequency determined by the underlying gene defect.
