  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of Bartter syndrome characterized by maternal polyhydramnios
      premature delivery salt loss polyuria and sensorineural deafness associated
      with hypokalemic and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis increased levels of plasma
      renin and aldosterone and low to normal blood pressure. Urinary calcium excretion
      rates are variable and nephrocalcinosis is typically absent.
