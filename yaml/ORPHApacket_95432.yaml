  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized
      by a primary dissolution of language with relative sparing of other mental faculties
      for at least the first 2 years of illness. PPA is recognized as the language
      variant in the frontotemporal dementia (FTD) spectrum of disorders. PPA can
      be classified into 3 subtypes based on specific speech and language features:
      semantic dementia (SD) progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) and logopenic progressive
      aphasia (lv-PPA).'
