  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism (DHI) characterized
      by hypoglycemic epiosodes that are usually mild escaping detection during infancy
      and usually a good clinical response to diazoxide (but some are diazoxide resistant).
      Autosomal dominant hyperinsulinism due to Kir6.2 deficiency usually has a milder
      phenotype when compared to that resulting from recessive K+ (K-ATP) channel
      mutations (Recessive forms of diazoxide-resistant hyperinsulinism).
