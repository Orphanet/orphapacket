    Contents: A rare genetic leukodystrophy characterized by infantile onset of stagnation
      and regression of motor and language development resulting in complete lack
      of communication and purposeful movement. Further neurological manifestations
      include truncal hypotonia appendicular spasticity dystonia optic disc pallor
      peripheral neuropathy and neurogenic bladder. Patients also present multiple
      contractures late-onset relative macrocephaly short stature and facial dysmorphism
      (including coarse facial features sloping forehead thick eyebrows low-set ears
      prominent nose flat philtrum and prominent lower lip). Brain imaging at advanced
      stages shows diffuse abnormal white matter signal and severe atrophy. Sural
      nerve biopsy reveals decreased myelination.
