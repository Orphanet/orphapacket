  TextSection:
    Contents: Idiopathic bronchiectasis&#160;(IB) is a progressive lung disease characterized
      by chronic dilation of the bronchi and destruction of the bronchial walls in
      the absence of any underlying cause (such as post infectious disease aspiration
      immunodeficiency congenital abnormalities and ciliary anomalies).
