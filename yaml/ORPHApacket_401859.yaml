  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by a neonatal onset of seizures
      (often intractable) muscular hypotonia feeding difficulties (poor sucking and/or
      swallowing) and mild to severe psychomotor delay associated with nonketotic
      hyperglycinemia typically revealed by biochemical analysis. Respiratory problems
      (apnea acute respiratory acidosis) lethargy hearing loss microcephaly and spasticity
      with pyramidal signs may also be associated.
