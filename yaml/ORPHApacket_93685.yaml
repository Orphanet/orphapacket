  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lymphoid hemopathy characterized by involvement of a single lymph
      node or a group of lymph nodes in one lymph node station (most commonly in the
      mediastinum neck abdomen or retroperitoneum). Histopathologically it may occur
      as a hyaline vascular subtype with hyaline-vascular follicles and a fibrotic
      and hypervascular stroma with sinus compression or a mixed/plasmacytic subtype
      with dense interfollicular sheets of (usually polytypic) plasma cells extending
      to the cortex and variably sized lymphoid follicles including some with regressive
      changes. Clinically most patients are asymptomatic and lesions are detected
      incidentally.
