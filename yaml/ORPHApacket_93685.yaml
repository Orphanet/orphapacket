  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by involvement
      of a single lymph node or a group of lymph nodes in one lymph node station (most
      commonly in the mediastinum neck abdomen or retroperitoneum). Histopathologically
      it may occur as a hyaline vascular subtype with hyaline-vascular follicles and
      a fibrotic and hypervascular stroma with sinus compression or a mixed/plasmacytic
      subtype with dense interfollicular sheets of (usually polytypic) plasma cells
      extending to the cortex and variably sized lymphoid follicles including some
      with regressive changes. Clinically most patients are asymptomatic and lesions
      are detected incidentally.
