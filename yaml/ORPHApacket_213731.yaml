  TextSection:
    Contents: High-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma of the corpus uteri is an extremely
      rare aggressive primary uterine neoplasm originating from neuroendocrine cells
      scattered within the endometrium characterized macroscopically by a bulky frequently
      polypoid mass with abundant necrosis located in the uterus and histologically
      by rosette-like and cord-like structures consisting of small rounded cells with
      oval nuclei and scarce cytoplasm. Patients often present with dysfunctional
      uterine bleeding pelvic or abdominal mass and especially in later stages of
      the disease abdominal pain. Symptomatic metastatic spread or symptoms related
      to a paraneoplastic syndrome such as retinopathy or Cushing syndrome due to
      ectopic ACTH production may be associated.
