  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by rapid onset
      of crops of asymptomatic small red to brown papules typically distributed symmetrically
      over the face trunk and proximal extremities occasionally with mucous membrane
      involvement. The lesions resolve spontaneously without scarring after a variable
      time span and do not recur in most cases. Histopathology reveals diffuse uniform
      dermal infiltration with non-xanthomatous histiocytes staining positive for
      CD68 and Ki-M1p. Multinucleate giant cells may occasionally be found.
