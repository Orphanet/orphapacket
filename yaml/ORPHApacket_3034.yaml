  TextSection:
    Contents: Delayed membranous cranial ossification is a rare genetic primary bone
      dysplasia characterized by absent ossification of calvarial bones at birth and
      characteristic facial dysmorphisms (frontal bossing hypertelorism downward-slanting
      palpebral fissures proptosis flat nasal bridge low-set ears midface retrusion).
      Patients present a soft skull at birth which over time progressively ossifies
      and in adulthood typically results in a deformed skull (with brachycephaly and
      prominent occiput). No other skeletal abnormalities are associated and patients
      have normal cognitive and motor development.
