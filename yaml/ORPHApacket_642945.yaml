  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of Perrault syndrome characterized by sensorineural hearing loss
      and ovarian dysgenesis in females. No neurological features are observed. Hearing
      loss is sensorineural generally bilateral prelingual progressive sometimes asymmetric
      and manifests with variable severity (mild to profound). Majority of the cases
      have primary amenorrhea.
