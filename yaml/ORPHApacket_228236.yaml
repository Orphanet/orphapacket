  TextSection:
    Contents: Linear focal elastosis is a rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder
      characterized by asymptomatic palpable hypertrophic or atrophic yellowish or
      red indurated horizontal striae-like linear plaques distributed symmetrically
      across the mid and lower back. No systemic involvement has been described. Skin
      biopsy reveals a focal increase in abnormal elastic tissue with abundant wavy
      fragmented and aggregated basophilic elastic fibers in the reticular dermis.
