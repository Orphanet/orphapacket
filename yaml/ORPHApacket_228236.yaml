    Contents: Linear focal elastosis is a rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder
      characterized by asymptomatic palpable hypertrophic or atrophic yellowish or
      red indurated horizontal striae-like linear plaques distributed symmetrically

      fragmented and aggregated basophilic elastic fibers in the reticular dermis.
