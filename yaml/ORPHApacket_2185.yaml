  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare central nervous system malformation characterized by abnormally
      enlarged cerebral ventricles due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation.
      It arises in utero and can be either acquired or inherited. The severity of
      the resulting brain damage depends on the duration and extent of ventriculomegaly.
