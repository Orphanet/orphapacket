  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lateral facial cleft characterized by a temporo-zygomatic defect
      usually with absence of the zygomatic arch and deformities of the mandibular
      ramus condyle and coronoid process. Associated soft tissue abnormalities include
      malformations of the ear and hypoplasia or absence of the temporal muscle. Preauricular
      hair may be absent or divided into two portions. Facial manifestations include
      macrostomia (with extension of the cleft to the corner of the mouth) and pre-auricular
      tags. Incomplete clefts may be found in the molar region and between the maxillary
      tuberosity and pterygoid process.
