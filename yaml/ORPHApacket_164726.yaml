  TextSection:
    Contents: A subgroup of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) associated with
      treatment of an unrelated neoplastic disease with radiation. The neoplastic
      cells typically harbor unbalanced aberrations of chromosomes 5 and 7 (monosomy
      5/del(5q) and monosomy 7/del(7q)) or a complex karyotype. Patients frequently
      present with multilineage dysplasia and cytopenias 5-10 years after exposure.
