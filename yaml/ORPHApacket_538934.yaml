  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by an
      abnormal immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection caused by hemizygous
      mutations in the X-linked <i>XIAP</i> gene resulting in B cell lymphoproliferation
      and manifesting with various phenotypes which include EBV-driven hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis hypogammaglobulinemia recurrent splenomegaly hepatitis colitis
      and intestinal bowel disease with features of Crohn's disease. Additional manifestations
      include variable auto-inflammatory symptoms such as uveitis arthritis skin abscesses
      erythema nodosum and nephritis. Neurological involvement is rare and lymphoma
      is never observed. Laboratory findings include normal or increased activated
      T cells low or normal iNKT cells and normal or reduced memory B cells.
