  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked leukodystrophy characterized primarily by spastic gait
      and autonomic dysfunction. When additional central nervous system (CNS) signs
      such as intellectual deficit ataxia or extrapyramidal signs are present the
      syndrome is referred to as complicated SPG.
