  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-cleft palate-abnormal retinal pigmentation syndrome is
      a rare orofacial clefting syndrome characterized by microcephaly cleft of the
      secondary palate and other variable abnormalities including abnormal retinal
      pigmentation facial dysmorphism with hypotelorism and maxillary hypoplasia.
      Goiter camptodactyly abnormal dermatoglyphics and mild intellectual disability
      may also be associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1983.
