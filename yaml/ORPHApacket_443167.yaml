  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare tumor characterized by a rapidly growing mass usually arising
      along the midline defined by the presence of <i>NUTM1</i> rearrangements. Histopathological
      examination shows a poorly differentiated carcinoma often with evidence of squamous
      differentiation. Patients present with unspecific signs and symptoms due to
      mass effect depending on the location. Extensive local invasion of adjacent
      structures lymph node involvement and distant metastatic disease are often present
      at the time of diagnosis. Prognosis is generally poor.
