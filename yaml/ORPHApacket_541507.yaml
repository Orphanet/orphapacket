    Contents: A rare coronary artery congenital malformation characterized by an anomalous
      origin of the left (ALCAPA) or right (ARCAPA) coronary artery from the pulmonary
      artery with variable clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to early
      heart failure and death depending on the degree of development of collateral
      circulation between the left and right coronary artery systems as well as the
      pressure level of the pulmonary artery. Infants typically present with feeding
      difficulties failure to thrive dyspnea irritability hyperhidrosis heart murmurs
      tachypnea tachycardia and/or chest pain while adults usually associate dyspnea
      chest pain syncope and intolerance to physical exercise. Sudden death may occur
      due to congestive heart failure myocardial infarction valvular insufficiencies
      or ventricular arrhythmias. The majority of cases reported are of an ALCAPA
      while ARCAPA is rarely observed.
