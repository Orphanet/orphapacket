    Contents: "A rare mosaic form of Legius syndrome characterized by findings typical\
      \ of Legius syndrome namely multiple caf\xE9-au-lait macules (CALMs) with or\
      \ without axillary or inguinal freckling. Mosaic form is caused by postzygotic\
      \ pathogenic variants in SPRED1 gene. In mosaic Legius syndrome the allelic/tissue\
      \ distribution of the pathogenic SPRED1-variant clearly suggests mosaicsm and/or\
      \ the distribution of CALMs is segmental. The phenotype can be milder than in\
      \ Legius syndrome."
