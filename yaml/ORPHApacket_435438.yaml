  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by childhood to adolescent
      onset of progressive myoclonus (which becomes very severe and results in major
      motor impediment) associated with infrequent tonic-clonic seizures and occasionally
      ataxia. Learning disability prior to seizure onset and mild cognitive decline
      may be associated.
