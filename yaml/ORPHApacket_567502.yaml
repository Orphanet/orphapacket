    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by almost complete lack of B-cells and severe hypogammaglobulinemia anomalies
      of the hands and feet urogenital malformations and characteristic facial dysmorphism
      (including microcephaly highly arched eyebrows hypoplastic alae nasi and micrognathia).
