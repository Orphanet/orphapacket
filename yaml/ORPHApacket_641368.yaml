  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hyper-IgE syndrome characterized by atopic dermatitis (eczema)
      chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and elevated IgE levels due to ZNF341 deficiency.
      High plasma levels of IgG and low natural killer (NK) cell numbers are observed.
      Other major clinical features involve recurrent skin infections with skin abscesses
      and connective tissue abnormalities. Some patients may have recurrent lung infections.
