  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked calvarial hyperostosis is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia
      with increased bone density disorder characterized by benign isolated calvarial
      thickening presenting with prominent frontoparietal bones a high forehead with
      ridging of the metopic and sagittal sutures lateral frontal prominences and
      facial dysmorphism comprising a flat nasal root and short upturned nose. Increased
      intracranial pressure and cranial nerve entrapment are not associated. There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1986.
