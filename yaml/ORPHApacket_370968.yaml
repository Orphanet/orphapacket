  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic congenital muscular dystrophy due to dystroglycanopathy
      disorder characterized by a wide phenotypic spectrum which includes hypotonia
      and muscular weakness present at birth or early infancy and delayed or arrested
      motor development associated with mild to severe intellectual disability and
      variable brain abnormalities on neuroimaging studies. Feeding difficulties joint
      and spinal deformities respiratory insufficiency and ocular anomalies (e.g.
      strabismus retinal dystrophy oculomotor apraxia) may be associated. Decreased
      or absent alpha-dystroglycan on immunohistochemical muscle staining and elevated
      serum creatine kinase are observed.
