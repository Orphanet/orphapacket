  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare superficial corneal dystrophy characterized by progressive opacity
      of the most anterior corneal layers. Slit-lamp examination reveals typical confluent
      translucent subepithelial deposits extending in size and growing into clusters
      of golden droplets covering the cornea with disease progression. Patients present
      variably compromised visual acuity depending on the stage of the disease. In
      advanced stages decreased corneal sensation may lead to corneal trophic changes
      perforation and permanent visual loss.
