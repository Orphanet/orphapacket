  TextSection:
    Contents: DPAGT1-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by hypotonia intractable seizures developmental delay microcephaly
      and severe fetal hypokinesia. Additional features that may be observed include
      apnea and respiratory deficiency cataracts joint contractures vermian hypoplasia
      dysmorphic features (esotropia arched palate micrognathia finger clinodactyly
      single flexion creases) and feeding difficulties. The disease is caused by loss-of-function
      mutations in the gene <i>DPAGT1 </i> (11q23.3).
