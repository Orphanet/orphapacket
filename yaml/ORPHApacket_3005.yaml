  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bone dysplasia characterized by long bones with wide and expanded
      metaphyses thin cortical bone and bone fragility. The metaphyseal widening and
      undermodeling extends well into the diaphysis and causes in the distal femur
      the typical ''Erlenmeyer flask'' or ''paddle'' appearance. Bone undermodeling
      is also seen in the tubular bones of the hands where there is lack of diaphyseal
      constriction. Common clinical features include genua valga big clavicles and
      dental anomalies. Mild hyperostosis of the skull and mild platyspondyly can
      also be observed on radiographs.
