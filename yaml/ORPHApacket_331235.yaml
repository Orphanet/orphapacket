  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent and/or invasive
      bacterial viral and fungal infections associated with low to absent blood IgM
      levels while IgG IgG subclasses and IgA levels as well as IgG antibody response
      to vaccinations are normal. Patients may also present allergic diatheses and
      the prevalence of autoimmune diseases is increased.
