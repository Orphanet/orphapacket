  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare acrofacial dysostosis characterized by normal intelligence
      shortness of stature and mild acrofacial dysostosis (malar hypoplasia micrognathia
      and webbing of digits with shortening of the fourth metacarpals) associated
      with oligodontia normal or high arched palate aplasia cutis verticis with pili
      torti mild cutaneous syndactyly of digits 2-5 webbing of digits and shortening
      of the fourth metacarpals and unilateral cleft lip. Features are similar to
      those seen in Zlotogora-Ogur syndrome although the latter shows no sign of acrofacial
      dysostosis. There have been no further reports in the literature since 1997.
