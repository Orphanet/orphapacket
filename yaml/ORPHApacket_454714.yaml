    Contents: A rare plasma cell neoplasm characterized by peripheral plasmacytosis
      usually with extensive and diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow and monoclonal
      paraproteinemia. Neoplastic plasma cells may also be found in extramedullary
      sites such as the liver or spleen among others. Most cases present as primary
      plasma cell leukemia without previous diagnosis of myeloma. The condition can
      also represent leukemic transformation of plasma cell myeloma (secondary plasma
      cell leukemia). Clinical manifestations include lymphadenopathy organomegaly
      renal failure bone marrow failure and peripheral neuropathies. High serum levels
      of lactate dehydrogenase and beta2-microglobulin as well as hypercalcemia (potentially
      leading to hypercalcemic crisis) are typically observed.
