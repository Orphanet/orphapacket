  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized
      by total or partial colonic aganglionosis associated with peripheral usually
      multifocal neuroblastic tumors (ganglioneuroblastoma neuroblastoma ganglioneuroma).
      Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome with variable severity of respiratory
      compromise cardiovascular and ophthalmologic symptoms consistent with autonomic
      nervous system dysfunction is occasionally associated.
