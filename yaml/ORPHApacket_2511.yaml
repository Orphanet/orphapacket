    Contents: Microbrachycephaly-ptosis-cleft lip syndrome is characterised by the
      association of intellectual deficit microbrachycephaly hypotelorism palpebral
      ptosis a thin/long face cleft lip and anomalies of the lumbar vertebra sacrum
      and pelvis. It has been described in two Brazilian sisters. Transmission appears
      to be autosomal recessive.
