  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 45 is a rare pure or complex
      form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by onset in infancy of progressive
      lower limb spasticity abnormal gait increased deep tendon reflexes and extensor
      plantar responses that may be associated with intellectual disability. Additional
      signs such as contractures in the lower limbs amyotrophy clubfoot and optic
      atrophy have also been reported.
