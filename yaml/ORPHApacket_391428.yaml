  TextSection:
    Contents: A clinical subtype of HSD10 disease a rare neurometabolic disorder.
      Affected boys may show lethargy poor feeding and evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction
      in the newborn period with subsequent mild developmental delay and abnormal
      muscle tone. Hallmark of the disease is progressive neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy
      which usually manifests between ages 6 months and 2 years with developmental
      regression progressive visual and hearing loss epilepsy and other neurological
      symptoms and severe cardiomyopathy. Laboratory investigations show signs of
      mitochondrial dysfunction and increased urinary excretion of specific isoleucine
      metabolites. The disease is often fatal around 2-4 years of age.
