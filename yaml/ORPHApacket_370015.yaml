    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia disorder characterized by normal birth
      length with early postnatal growth deficiency resulting in severe disproportionate
      short stature (with short trunk and limbs) severe genu varum flexion contractures
      in the hips and lumbar hyperlordosis. Radiological findings reveal platyspondyly
      with central indentation of vertebral endplates progressive and severe epimetaphyseal
      abnormalities that primarily affect the lower limbs and include very small irregular
      proximal femoral and knee epiphyses severe coxa vara delayed ossification of
      proximal femoral epiphyses and irregular distal femoral and proximal tibial
      metaphyses.
