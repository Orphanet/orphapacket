  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare eye tumor characterized by a flat to nodular conjunctival mass
      with variable pigmentation. It can arise in any part of the conjunctiva but
      most often presents on the bulbar surface near the limbus. Invasion of corneal
      tissue eyelid margin sclera or orbit may occur in advanced tumors. Metastatic
      spread most commonly involves regional lymph nodes or the lung liver and brain.
      Essential diagnostic criteria are stromal invasion and severe cytological and
      architectural atypia exceeding those expected in a naevus. Desirable criteria
      are demonstration of melanocytic markers by immunohistochemistry pagetoid growth
      mitotic activity invasion into cornea or skin ulceration and tumor necrosis.
