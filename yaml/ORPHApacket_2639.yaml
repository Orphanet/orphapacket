  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome characterised by severe reduction or absence of the
      fibula and complex brachydactyly. Less than 30 cases have been described in
      the literature so far. The syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner
      and is caused by mutations in the cartilage-derived morphogenetic protein-1
      gene (<i>GDF5</i>).
