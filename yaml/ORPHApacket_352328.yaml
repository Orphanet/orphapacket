  TextSection:
    Contents: MEGDEL syndrome is a rare genetic neurometabolic disorder characterized
      by neonatal hypoglycemia features of sepsis that are not linked to infection
      development of feeding problems failure to thrive transient liver dysfunction
      and truncal hypotonia followed by dystonia and spasticity which results in psychomotor
      development arrest and/or regression. Progressive sensorineural deafness intellectual
      disability and absent speech are also associated. Laboratory tests demonstrate
      3-methylglutaconic aciduria and temporary elevated serum lactate and transaminases.
