  TextSection:
    Contents: Bonnemann-Meinecke-Reich syndrome is a syndrome of multiple congenital
      anomalies characterized by an encephalopathy which predominantly occurs in the
      first year of life and presenting as psychomotor delay. Additional features
      of the disease include moderate dysmorphia craniosynostosis dwarfism (due to
      growth hormone deficiency) intellectual disability spasticity ataxia retinal
      degeneration and adrenal and uterine hypoplasia. The disease has been described
      in only two families with each family having two affected siblings. An autosomal
      recessive inheritance has been suggested. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1991.
