  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a rare immune disease and a potentially
      life-threatening disorder characterized by cytokine storm and overwhelming inflammation
      causing fever hepatosplenomegaly cytopenia hypertriglyceridemia hyperferritinemia
      and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow liver spleen or lymph nodes. It can be either
      primary due to a genetic defect (primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis
      ) or secondary to malignancies to infections most commonly with viruses such
      as Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus human immunodeficiency virus or to
      autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or adult-onset Still
      disease (secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis).
