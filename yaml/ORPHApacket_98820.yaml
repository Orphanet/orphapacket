  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci is a rare genetic epilepsy
      disorder characterized by autosomal dominant lesional and nonlesional focal
      epilepsy with variable penetrance. Focal seizures emanate from different cortical
      locations (temporal frontal centroparietal parietal parietaloccipital occipital)
      in different family members but for each individual a single focus remains constant
      throughout lifetime. Seizure type (tonic tonic-clonic or hyperkinetic) and severity
      varies among family members and tends to decrease (but do not disappear) during
      adulthood. Many patients have an aura and show automatisms during diurnal seizures
      whereas others have nocturnal seizures. Most individuals are of normal intelligence
      but patients with intellectual disability autistic spectrum disorder and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder have been described.
