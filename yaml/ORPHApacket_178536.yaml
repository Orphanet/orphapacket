      red to violaceous papules plaques or nodules localized predominantly on the
      trunk and extremities. Histologically these are dermis infiltrates consisting
      of small marginal zone B cells lymphoplasmacytic cells and plasma cells. Marginal
      zone B cells express CD20 CD79a and Bcl-2 and are negative for CD5 CD10 and
      Bcl-6. Plasma cells are typically located at the periphery and express CD138
      CD79a and monotypic light chains.
