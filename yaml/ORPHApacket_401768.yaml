  TextSection:
    Contents: Proximal myopathy with extrapyramidal signs is a rare hereditary non-dystrophic
      myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness delayed motor development
      learning difficulties and progressive extrapyramidal motor signs including chorea
      dystonia and tremor. Variable additional features have been reported - ataxia
      microcephaly ophthalmoplegia ptosis and optic atrophy.
