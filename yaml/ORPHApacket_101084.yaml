  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1D (CMT1D) is a form of CMT1 caused
      by mutations in the <i>EGR2</i> gene (10q21.1) with a variable severity and
      age of onset (from infancy to adulthood) that usually presents with gait abnormalities
      progressive wasting and weakness of distal limb muscles with possible later
      involvement of proximal muscles foot deformity and severe reduction in nerve
      conduction velocity. Additional features may include scoliosis cranial nerve
      deficits such as diplopia and bilateral vocal cord paresis.
