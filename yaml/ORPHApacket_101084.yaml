      term) caused by mutations in the <i>EGR2</i> gene (10q21.1) with a variable
      severity and age of onset (from infancy to adulthood) that usually presents
      with gait abnormalities progressive wasting and weakness of distal limb muscles
      with possible later involvement of proximal muscles foot deformity and severe
