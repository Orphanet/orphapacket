  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare epidermal disease characterized by the association of punctate
      acrokeratoderma with a pigmentary disorder. Patients present skin-colored keratotic
      papules on the hands and feet and pronounced hyperkeratosis of the palms and
      soles. Freckle-like pigmentation on the dorsal surfaces of the hands and feet
      is also reported. Histological examination reveals no fragmentation of dermal
      elastic tissue. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1993.
