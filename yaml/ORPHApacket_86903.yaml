    Contents: A rare dendritic cell tumor characterized by a neoplasm composed of
      spindled to ovoid cells with phenotypic features similar to those of normal
      indeterminate cells. The tumor cells consistently express S100 protein and CD1a
      while langerin specific B- and T-cell markers CD30 the histiocytic marker CD163
      and the follicular dendritic cell markers CD21 CD23 and CD35 are negative. Birbeck
      granules are absent on ultrastructural examination. Patients typically present
      with multiple papules nodules or plaques of the skin. Primary lymph node or
      splenic involvement is less common. Systemic symptoms are usually absent. The
      clinical course is highly variable.
