  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital diazoxide-resistant hyperinsulinism characterized
      by recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia caused by an excessive/uncontrolled
      insulin secretion (inappropriate for the level of glycemia) due to a focal adenomatous
      hyperplasia of pancreas that is unresponsive to medical treatment with diazoxide.
