  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive external ophthalmoplegia-myopathy-emaciation syndrome is
      a rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder due to nuclear DNA anomalies
      characterized by progressive external ophthalmoplegia without diplopia cerebellar
      atrophy proximal skeletal muscle weakness with generalized muscle wasting profound
      emaciation respiratory failure spinal deformity and facial muscle weakness (manifesting
      with ptosis dysphonia dysphagia and nasal speech). Intellectual disability gastrointestinal
      symptoms (e.g. nausea abdominal fullness and loss of appetite) dilated cardiomyopathy
      and renal colic have also been reported.
