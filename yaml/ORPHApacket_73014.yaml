    Contents: 'Intractable diarrhea of infancy (IDI) is a heterogeneous syndrome that
      includes several diseases with different etiologies. Provisional classification
      of IDI according to villous atrophy and based on immunohistological criteria
      distinguishes two clearly different groups of IDI: 1) Immune-mediated: characterised
      by a mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria and considered as being
      related to T cell activation. 2) The second histological pattern includes early
      onset severe intractable diarrhea histologically characterised by villous atrophy
      with low or without mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria but
      specific histological abnormalities involving the epithelium.'
