  TextSection:
    Contents: Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 20 (UPD 20) is a very rare
      chromosomal anomaly in which both copies of chromosome 20 are inherited from
      the mother. The main feature described is prenatal and postnatal growth retardation.
      Microcephaly minor dysmorphic features and psychomotor developmental delay have
      been occasionally reported. Maternal UPD20 is most often ascertained by a mosaic
      trisomy 20 pregnancy.
