  TextSection:
    Contents: Moyamoya disease with early-onset achalasia is an exceedingly rare autosomal
      recessive neurological disorder reported only in a few families so far. It is
      characterized by the association of early onset achalasia (manifesting in infancy)
      with severe intracranial angiopathy that is consistent with moyamoya angiopathy
      in most cases (moyamoya disease; see this term). Other variable associated manifestations
      include hypertension Raynaud phenomenon and livedo reticularis.
