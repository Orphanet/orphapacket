  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature due to partial GHR deficiency is a rare genetic endocrine
      disease characterized by idiopathic short stature due to diminished GHR function
      (decreased ligand binding or reduced availability of receptor) thus resulting
      in partial insensitivity to growth hormone.
