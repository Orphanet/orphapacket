  TextSection:
    Contents: Paraquat poisoning is a rare intoxication with paraquat (a non-selective
      bipyridilium herbicide that has been banned in Europe) usually occurring through
      ingestion of the poison and that presents with caustic injury of the oral cavity
      and pharynx as well as nausea vomiting epigastric pain lethargy loss of consciousness
      and fever. Patients may develop potentially life-threatening complications such
      as hepatic dysfunction acute tubular necrosis and renal insufficiency and respiratory
      failure (due to pulmonary fibrosis) due to its inherent toxicity and lack of
      effective treatment. Intoxication via inhalation injection and dermal or mucus
      contact have also been reported.
