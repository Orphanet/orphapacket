    Contents: A fibroinflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland occuring more frequently
      in females characterized a large hard thyroid mass and presenting with pressure
      symptoms (breathing difficulties and dysphagia) or voice hoarseness and aphonia
      (impingement of recurrent laryngeal nerve). It can often be associated with
      extracervical fibroinflammatory disorders such as retroperitoneal fibrosis primary
      scleroisng cholangitis and autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto struma Addison
