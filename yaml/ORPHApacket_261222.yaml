  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal 16p11.2 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly
      syndrome resulting from the partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome
      16 with a highly variable phenotype typically characterized by developmental
      delay mild intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Macrocephaly
      (apparent by 2 years of age) structural brain malformations epilepsy vertebral
      anomalies and obesity are frequently associated.
