  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic punctate palmoplantar keratoderma disease characterized
      by discrete focal punctate keratoderma on the palms and soles and/or slowly
      progressive spastic paralysis predominantly affecting the lower limbs. Lesional
      histology reveals pronounced orthokeratosis acanthosis papillomatosis and regular
      undulation to the surface keratin. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1983.
