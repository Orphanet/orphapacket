  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic male infertility due to a sperm disorder characterized
      by the absence of a measurable amount of spermatozoa in the ejaculate (azoospermia)
      or a number of sperm in the ejaculate inferior to 15 million/mL (oligozoospermia)
      resulting from a mutation in a single gene known to cause azoo- or oligo-spermia.
      Sperm morphology may be normal.
