    Contents: Mesomelic dysplasia Savarirayan type is characterised by severely hypoplastic
      and triangular-shaped tibiae and absence of the fibulae. So far two sporadic
      cases have been described. Moderate mesomelia of the upper limbs proximal widening
      of the ulnas pelvic anomalies and marked bilateral glenoid hypoplasia were also
      reported.
