  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized
      by congenital muscle hypotonia congenital or early-onset kyphoscoliosis (progressive
      or non-progressive) and generalized joint hypermobility with dislocations/subluxations
      (in particular of the shoulders hips and knees). Additional common features
      are skin hyperextensibility easy bruising of the skin rupture/aneurysm of a
      medium-sized artery osteopenia/osteoporosis blue sclerae umbilical or inguinal
      hernia chest deformity marfanoid habitus talipes equinovarus and refractive
      errors. Subtype-specific manifestations include congenital hearing impairment
      (sensorineural conductive or mixed) follicular hyperkeratosis muscle atrophy
      and bladder diverticula. Molecular testing is obligatory to confirm the diagnosis.
