  TextSection:
    Contents: Brachydactyly-elbow wrist dysplasia syndrome is a rare genetic bone
      development disorder characterized by dysplasia of all the bony components of
      the elbow joint abnormally shaped carpal bones wrist joint radial deviation
      and brachydactyly. Patients typically present with slight flexion at the elbow
      joints (with impossibilty to perform active extension) and usually associate
      a limited range of motion of the elbow wrist and finger articulations. Camptodactyly
      and syndactyly have also been reported.
