    Contents: Microcephaly-short stature-intellectual disability-facial dysmorphism
      syndrome is a rare genetic malformation syndrome with short stature characterized
      by postnatal microcephaly failure to thrive and short stature global developmental
      delay and intellectual disability hypotonia dysmorphic features (short nose
      depressed nasal bridge low set ears short neck clinodactyly and cutaneous syndactyly
      of T2-3 at birth and broad forehead midface retrusion epicanthal folds laterally
      sparse eyebrows short nose long philtrum widely spaced teeth micrognathia and
      coarsening of facial features later in life). Other associated features include
      postnatal transient generalized edema myopia strabismus hypothyroidism.
