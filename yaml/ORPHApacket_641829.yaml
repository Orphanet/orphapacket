    Contents: A rare non-inflammatory vasculopathy characterized by intracompartmental
      pressure typically in a distal upper extremity due to intrauterine ischemia
      and external compression. Affected limb presents significant swelling and sentinel
      skin changes (desquamation blister/bullae formation and skin necrosis). It can
      lead to long-term sequelae including Volkmann contracture limb length discrepancies,bone
      growth abnormalities and nerve lesions. Neurologic involvement ranging from
      sensory and motor nerve palsies to complete hand paralysis may persist.
