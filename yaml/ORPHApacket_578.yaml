  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lysosomal storage disease characterized clinically by severe
      global development delay due to neuronal dysmyelination hypotonia which gradually
      progresses to spasticity during childhood speech deficits progressive visual
      impairment (due to corneal clouding retinal degeneration and optic atrophy)
      achlorhydria with increased gastrin secretion and iron deficiency anemia and
      kidney disease and failure all in the absence of dysmorphic features.
