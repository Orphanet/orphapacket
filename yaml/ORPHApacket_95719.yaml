  TextSection:
    Contents: Thyroid hemiagenesis is a form of thyroid dysgenesis (see this term)
      characterized by an absence of half of the thyroid gland that is usually asymptomatic
      but may result in primary congenital hypothyroidism (see this term) a permanent
      thyroid deficiency that is present from birth.
