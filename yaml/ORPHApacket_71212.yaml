  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of congenital diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism
      due to short chain 3 hydroxylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCHAD; <i>HADH</i> gene)
      deficiency and characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia with seizures
      and reported to respond well to diazoxide. It presents with the classical manifestations
      of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Exceptional complications include sudden death
      and in one case fulminant hepatic failure.
