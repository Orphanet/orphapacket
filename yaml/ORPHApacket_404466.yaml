  TextSection:
    Contents: Female infertility due to zona pellucida defect is a rare genetic female
      infertility disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal oocytes that
      lack a zona pellucida. Affected individuals are unable to conceive despite having
      normal menstrual cycles and sex hormone levels as well as no obstructions in
      the fallopian tubes or defects of the uterus or adnexa.
