    Contents: A rare macular disorder characterized mostly by a variable degree of
      decreased visual acuity jerk or pendular nystagmus and typical ocular findings
      at imaging. The disease is usually bilateral. Rarely nystagmus can be absent.
      Locally the disease is characterized by underdeveloped foveal pit absence of
      foveal pigmentation and/or foveal avascular zone and persistence of inner retinal
      layers at the fovea in absence of concomitant ocular or systemic pathology.
