  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-syndromic male infertility due to sperm motility disorder is a rare
      genetic non-syndromic male infertility disorder characterized by infertility
      due to sperm with defects in their cilia/flagella structure leading to absent
      motility or reduced forward motility in fresh ejaculate. Reduced semen volume
      oligospermia and an increased number of abnormally structured spermatozoa is
      often present.
