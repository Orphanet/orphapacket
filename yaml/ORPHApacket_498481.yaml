  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by reduced bone mineral
      density (defined as a Z score below -2.0) vertebral compression fractures and
      recurrent peripheral fractures caused by low-impact trauma leading to bone pain
      and impaired mobility. Patients typically become symptomatic in childhood or
      adolescence.
