    Contents: Pelvic dysplasia-arthrogryposis of lower limbs syndrome is a rare genetic
      dysostosis syndrome characterized by intrauterine growth restriction short stature
      (with short lower segment) lower limb joint contractures and muscular hypotrophy
      narrow small pelvis lumbar hyperlordosis with scoliosis and foot deformity (short
      overlapping toes). Imaging reveals ovoid/wedge-shaped vertebral bodies pelvic
      and skeletal hypoplasia with metatarsal fusion in the lower limbs and normal
