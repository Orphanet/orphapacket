  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 61 (SPG61) is a rare complex
      form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by an onset in infancy of
      spastic paraplegia (presenting with the inability to walk unsupported and a
      scissors gait) associated with a motor and sensory polyneuropathy with loss
      of terminal digits and acropathy. SPG61 is due to a mutation in the <i>ARL6IP1</i>
      gene (16p12-p11.2) encoding the ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting
      protein 1.
