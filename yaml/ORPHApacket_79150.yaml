    Contents: A rare hyperpigmentation of the skin disease characterized by the congenital
      to infantile-onset of bilateral diffuse (occasionally localized) reticulate
      (swirls and streaks) macular hyperpigmentation following the lines of Blaschko
      typically involving the trunk limbs head and neck (but sparing palms soles and
      mucosa) without preceding inflammation blistering or atrophy. Occasionally extracutaneous
      abnormalities including autism seizures cardiac defects skeletal abnormalities
      and developmental delay may be associated. Histologically basal and/or suprabasal
      melanosis without pigment incontinence is observed.
