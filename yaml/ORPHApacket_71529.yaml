  TextSection:
    Contents: Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deficiency is the commonest form of monogenic
      obesity identified so far. MC4R deficiency is characterised by severe obesity
      an increase in lean body mass and bone mineral density increased linear growth
      in early childhood hyperphagia beginning in the first year of life and severe
      hyperinsulinaemia in the presence of preserved reproductive function.
