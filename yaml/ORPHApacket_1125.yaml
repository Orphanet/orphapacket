  TextSection:
    Contents: Ocular motor apraxia Cogan type is characterised by impairment of voluntary
      horizontal eye movements and compensatory head thrust. Around 50 cases have
      been described so far. The oculomotor manifestations tend to improve with age
      but the syndrome may also be associated with learning and speech difficulties
      or in some cases cerebral malformations. Both sporadic and familial forms have
      been described with sporadic forms being more frequent. The mode of transmission
      of the familial form has not yet been clearly established. A gene located on
      the long arm of chromosome 2 near to the <i>NPHP1</i> gene involved in nephronophthisis
      may be associated with ocular motor apraxia Cogan type.
