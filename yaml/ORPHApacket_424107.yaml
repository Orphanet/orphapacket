  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital myopathy with myasthenic-like onset is a rare genetic non-dystrophic
      myopathy characterized by fatigable muscle weakness associated with congenital
      myopathy. Patients present with axial hypotonia myopathic facies with fatigable
      ptosis feeding difficulties delayed gross motor development and proximal limb
      weakness with a RYR1-related typical pattern of muscle involvement (i.e. severe
      involvement of the soleus muscle and sparring of the rectus femoris sartorius
      gracilis and semitendinous muscles). Scoliosis and frequent respiratory tract
      infections are additional observed features.
