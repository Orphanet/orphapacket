  TextSection:
    Contents: Craniosynostosis Philadelphia type is a form of syndromic craniosynostosis
      characterized by sagittal/dolichocephalic head shape with a relatively normal
      facial appearance and complete soft tissue syndactyly of hand and foot. Transmission
      is autosomal dominant with variable expression of the hand findings and incomplete
      penetrance of the sagittal craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis Philadelphia type
      has been suggested to share the same etiology as syndactyly type 1A.
