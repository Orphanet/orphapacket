  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized classically by late
      infantile-onset (5-10 years) with rapid disease progression myoclonus visual
      loss and progressive intellectual disability (commonly observed within 2-5 years
      of seizure onset). Spasticity dystonic posturing tremors and other extrapyramidal
      signs are also reported in these patients. Less frequently the disease can manifest
      with intractable tonic-clonic or complex partial seizures without myoclonous
      progressive intellectual disability and variable visual deficit blindness being
      infrequent. This condition also known as Northern epilepsy is milder and slow
      progressing compared to the classical form of the disease.
