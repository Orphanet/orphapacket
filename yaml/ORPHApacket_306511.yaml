  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia usually
      characterized by a pure phenotype of a slowly progressive spastic paraplegia
      associated with urinary incontinence with an onset in mid- to late-adulthood.
      A complex phenotype with the additional findings of cognitive impairment sensorimotor
      polyneuropathy ataxia parkinsonism and dystonia as well as thin corpus callosum
      and white matter lesions (seen on brain and spine magnetic resonance imaging)
      has also been reported.
