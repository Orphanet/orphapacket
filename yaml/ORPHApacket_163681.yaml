  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by
      moderate to mostly severe intellectual disability speech impairment with normal
      or mildly delayed motor development and early-onset seizures often accompanied
      by developmental regression. Autistic behavior and stereotypic movements are
      common.
