    Contents: A variant of mycosis fungoides (MF) characterized by the presence of
      folliculotropic infiltrates often with sparing of the epidermis and preferential
      involvement of the head and neck region. Most cases show mucinous degeneration
      of the hair follicles (follicular mucinosis) and are traditionally designated
      as MF-associated follicular mucinosis.
