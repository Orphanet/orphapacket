  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect of the eye characterized by a uni-
      or bilateral notch gap hole or fissure typically located in the inferonasal
      quadrant of the eye involving only the pigment epithelium or the iris stroma
      (incomplete) or involving both (complete) manifesting with iris shape anomalies
      (e.g. 'keyhole' or oval pupil) and/or photophobia. Association with colobomata
      in other parts of the eye (incl. ciliary body zonule choroid retina optic nerve)
      and complex malformation syndromes (such as CHARGE syndrome) may be observed.
