  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by adult onset of progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in the proximal upper
      and lower limbs leading to scapular winging and loss of independent ambulation.
      Respiratory function may become impaired in the course of the disease. Fatty
      degeneration of internal regions of thigh muscles sparing external areas has
      been reported as well as a reduction of alpha-dystroglycan in muscle biopsies.
