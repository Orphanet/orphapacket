  TextSection:
    Contents: 'PHACE is an acronym used to describe a syndrome characterised by the
      association of Posterior fossa brain malformations large facial Haemangiomas
      anatomical anomalies of the cerebral Arteries aortic coarctation and other Cardiac
      anomalies and Eye abnormalities. Sternal anomalies are also sometimes present
      and in these cases the syndrome is referred to as PHACES. Two additional manifestations
      have recently been added to the clinical spectrum of PHACE syndrome: stenosis
      of the vessels at the base of the skull and segmental longitudinal dilations
      of the internal carotid artery.'
