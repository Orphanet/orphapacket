  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare central nervous system tumor characterized by a well circumscribed
      astrocytic neoplasm typically arising peripherally in the frontal or parietal
      lobes. It usually presents in infants and young adults with symptoms of increased
      intracranial pressure epileptic seizures and/or neurological deficits. At the
      histomolecular level it exhibits astroblastic perivascular pseudorosettes and
      positive immunostaining for GFAP and EMA. It carries fusion of <i>MN1</i> with
      various partners (the most common being <i>BEND2</i> and <i>CXXC5</i>) and exhibits
      a specific astroblastoma MN1-altered DNA methylation class.
