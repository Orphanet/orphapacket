  TextSection:
    Contents: Low-grade neuroendocrine tumor of the corpus uteri is an extremely rare
      uterine cancer typically characterized by a well demarcated solid frequently
      pedunculated tumor originating from neuroendocrine cells scattered within the
      endometrium often associated with ectopic hormone production. Patients usually
      present with vaginal bleeding or discharge and a pelvic mass with a polypoid
      tumor sometimes protruding through the cervical canal. Symptoms related to ectopic
      hormone production (flushing sweating diarrhea bronchospasm) may also develop.
