  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe intellectual disability-epilepsy-anal anomalies-distal phalangeal
      hypoplasia is characterised by severe intellectual deficit epilepsy hypoplasia
      of the terminal phalanges and an anteriorly displaced anus. It has been described
      in two sisters born to consanguineous parents. The syndrome is transmitted as
      an autosomal recessive trait and appears to be caused by anomalies in to chromosome
      regions one localised to chromosome 1 and the other to chromosome 14.
