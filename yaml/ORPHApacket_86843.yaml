  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare unclassified acute myeloid leukemia characterized by an acute
      panmyeloid proliferation with blasts constituting more than 20% of cells in
      the bone marrow or peripheral blood accompanied by fibrosis of the bone marrow.
      Patients typically present with acute onset of severe constitutional symptoms
      bone pain and pancytopenia. Splenomegaly is minimal or absent. The disease is
      rapidly progressive with poor therapy response.
