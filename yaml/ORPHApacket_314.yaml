  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare immune deficiency with skin involvement characterized by early
      infantile onset of a clinical tetrad comprising generalized severe seborrheic-like
      erythroderma recurrent secondary bacterial or fungal infections (most commonly
      <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Candida and gram-negative bacteria) persistent
      profuse malabsorptive diarrhea and failure to thrive or marked wasting. Associated
      systemic symptoms include fever anemia and weight loss. Further critical complications
      are impaired thermoregulation and severe fluid loss due to extensive exfoliation.
