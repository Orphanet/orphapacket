    Contents: A rare immune deficiency with skin involvement characterized by early
      infantile onset of a clinical tetrad comprising generalized severe seborrheic-like
      erythroderma recurrent secondary bacterial or fungal infections (most commonly
      <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Candida and gram-negative bacteria) persistent
      profuse malabsorptive diarrhea and failure to thrive or marked wasting. Associated
