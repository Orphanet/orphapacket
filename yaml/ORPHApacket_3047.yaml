  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized
      by the association of a typical facial phenotype with microcephaly associated
      with congenital hypothyroidism skeletal involvement (polydactyly long thumb(s)
      and long first toe(s) and patellar hypoplasia/agenesis) and some degree of global
      developmental delay hypotonia and intellectual disability. Facial features include
      an immobile mask-like face severe blepharophimosis and ptosis tear duct abnormalities
      a broad nasal bridge bulbous nasal tip small mouth thin upper lip hypoplastic
      teeth and small low set ears. Renal and genital anomalies usually cryptorchidism
      are often present in affected males. Congenital heart defects and growth delay
      are variably present.
