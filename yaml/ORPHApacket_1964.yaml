    Contents: Extrasystoles-short stature-hyperpigmentation-microcephaly syndrome
      is a rare genetic malformation syndrome with short stature characterized by
      microcephaly borderline intellectual disability hyperpigmentation of the skin
      short stature and ventricular extrasystoles. Cardiac syncope may also be associated.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1975.
