  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome describes a group of rare
      inborn errors of energy metabolism due to defects in mitochondrial [4Fe-4S]
      protein assembly. Patients present with a neonatal/infancy onset of metabolic
      lactic acidosis (that may be associated with hyperglycinemia and other abnormal
      metabolic testing results) muscular hypotonia absence of psychomotor development
      or developmental regression as well as abnormal neuroimaging findings (including
      leukodystrophy brain developmental defects white matter abnormalities cerebral
      atrophy) and other variable clinical features (e.g. optic atrophy cardiomyopathy
      pulmonary hypertension seizures and dysmorphic features). Early fatal outcome
      is usual.
