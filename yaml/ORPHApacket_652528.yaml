    Contents: A rare non-syndromic renal/urinary tract malformation characterized
      by the presence of more than two kidneys (up to five) each of which mostly has
      its own collecting system vascular supply and distinct encapsulated parenchyma.
      The additional kidney(s) smaller than native ones mostly occurs ipsilateral
      and caudal to the left kidney and may be fused to the native kidneys. Patients
      are usually asymptomatic but they may present with symptoms such as pain a palpable
      abdominal mass fever and sometimes with urinary symptoms (such as urinary incontinence)
      when supernumerary kidneys occur with an ectopic ureter. Additional congenital
      abnormalities icluding horseshoe kidney malformation ventricular septal defect
      and cloacal abnormalities (such as urethral atresia vaginal atresia ectopic
      ureter implantation imperforate anus and duplication of urethra) may also be
      present in some patients.
