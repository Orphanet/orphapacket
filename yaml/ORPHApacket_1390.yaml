  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphyc syndrome characterized
      by slowly progressive night blindness skeletal abnormalities (sloping shoulders
      joint hyperextensibility minor radiological anomalies) and characteristic facial
      features (periorbital anomalies malar flatness retrognathia). Additional manifestations
      include myopia and extinguished electroretinograms. There have been no further
