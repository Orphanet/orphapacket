  TextSection:
    Contents: Extranodal nasal NK/T cell lymphoma (NKTCL) is a rare malignant neoplasm
      mainly affecting men in the fifth decade of life that usually arises in the
      nose paranasal sinuses orbits or upper airway and that can present with a nasal
      mass nasal bleeding nasal obstruction palate perforation (i.e. midline perforation
      of the hard palate) and mid-facial and/or upper airway destructive lesions.
      In advanced disease stages which are associated with a poor prognosis NKTCL
      may disseminate to other organs. A few cases of NKTCL presenting primarily in
      the lymph nodes have also been described.
