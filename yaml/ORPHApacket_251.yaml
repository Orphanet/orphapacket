  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare group of primary bone dysplasia disorders characterized by the
      association of epiphyseal anomalies of long bones causing joint pain early in
      life recurrent osteochondritis and early arthrosis. This group contains an heterogeneous
      group of diseases with variable expression. Common reported clinical signs include
      waddling gait and pain at onset and moderate short stature. Some forms are mainly
      limited to the femoral epiphyses while several other syndromes are characterized
      by the association of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with other clinical manifestations
      such as myopia deafness and facial dysmorphism. Diagnosis relies on identification
      of the radiological features.
