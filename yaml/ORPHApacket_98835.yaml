    Contents: A rare acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage characterized by clonal proliferation
      of primitive hematopoietic cells primarily in the bone marrow and blood lacking
      lineage-specific markers and detectable genotypic alterations. The patients
      present with leukocytosis anemia variable platelet count and a variety of nonspecific
      symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising
      recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement (lymphadenopathy
      splenomegaly hepatomegaly).
