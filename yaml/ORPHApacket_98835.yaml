      of primitive hematopoietic cells primarily in the bone marrow and blood lacking
      lineage-specific markers and detectable genotypic alterations. The patients
      present with leukocytosis anemia variable platelet count and a variety of nonspecific
      symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising
