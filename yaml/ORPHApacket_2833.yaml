  TextSection:
    Contents: Stiff skin syndrome is a rare slowly progressive cutaneous disease characterized
      by rock-hard skin bound firmly to the underlying tissues (mainly on the shoulders
      lower back buttocks and thighs) mild hypertrichosis and hyperpigmentation overlying
      the affected areas of skin as well as limited joint mobility (mainly of large
      joints) with flexion contractures. Cutaneous nodules affecting mostly distal
      interphalangeal joints as well as extracutaneous manifestations including diffuse
      entrapment neuropathy scoliosis a tiptoe gait and a narrow thorax may be associated.
      Restrictive pulmonary changes muscle weakness short stature and growth delay
      have also been reported. No vascular hyperreactivity immunologic abnormalities
      nor visceral muscular or bone involvement has been described.
