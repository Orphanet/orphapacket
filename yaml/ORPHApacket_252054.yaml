  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign highly vascularized tumor characterized by various symptoms
      depending on the location. They typically occur in the brain (typically cerebellum
      in addition to brainstem cerebrum) and spinal cord and predominantly affect
      the central nervous system. However they can also be found in peripheral nerves
      bone and soft tissue liver lung pancreas kidney intestines and skin in a lesser
      extent. They most commonly occur sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau
      syndrome. Patients having cerebellar tumors often present with headaches nausea
      vomiting and signs of increased intracranial pressure whereas patients having
      brainstem tumors develop motor and sensory deficits ataxia and potentially fatal
      hemorrhages. Hemangioblastomas located in spinal cord may result in localized
      pain motor weakness sensory disturbances and bowel or bladder dysfunction. Patients
      having optic nerve hemangioblastoma were also reported of either being asymptomatic
      or manifest vision loss proptosis and pain.
