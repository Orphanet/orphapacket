  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemangioblastoma is a rare benign highly vascularized tumor of the central
      nervous system most often located in the cerebellum or spinal cord presenting
      in adulthood and manifesting with dizziness nausea malaise headache bladder
      or bowel dysfunction numbness weakness and pain in the upper or lower extremities
      and often associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL; see this term). Exceptional
      cases of hemangioblastoma arising outside of the central nervous system have
      been reported.
