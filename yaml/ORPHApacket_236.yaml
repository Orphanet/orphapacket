  TextSection:
    Contents: Trisomy 9p is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from a partial
      or complete trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 9 with a wide phenotypic
      variablility typically characterized by intellectual disability craniofacial
      dysmorphism (e.g. microcephaly large anterior fontanel hypertelorism strabismus
      downslanting palpebral fissures malformed low-set protruding ears bulbous nose
      macrostomia down-turned corners of mouth micrognathia) digital anomalies (brachydactyly
      and clinodactyly) and short stature. Less frequently patients present with cardiopathy
      and renal skeletal and central nervous system malformations.
