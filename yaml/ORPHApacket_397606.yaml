  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder due to truncation mutations
      of the prion protein gene <i>PRNP</i> (20p13) leading to deposition of prion
      protein amyloid. Onset is usually in the fourth decade of life and reported
      clinical manifestations include diarrhea nausea autonomic failure (areflexia
      weakness) neurogenic bladder and urinary infections.
