  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by familial occurrence
      of lichen and/or macular amyloidosis due to fibrillary degeneration and apoptosis
      of basal keratinocytes followed by conversion of filamentous masses into amyloid
      material in the papillary dermis. Patients typically present with a pruritic
      eruption of grouped hyperkeratotic papules which may coalesce to form hyperkeratotic
      plaques with a predilection for the lower limbs (lichen amyloidosis) or with
      hyperpigmented macules sometimes with a reticulate pattern most commonly arising
      on the back chest or interscapular areas (macular amyloidosis).
