  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hepatic disease characterized by the overlap of primary biliary
      cholangitis and/or primary sclerosing cholangitis with autoimmune hepatitis
      defined by the presence of at least two of the three recognized biochemical
      serological and histological criteria of each disease. The onset of the overlapping
      diseases can be simultaneous or sequential with a variable interval of up to
      several years. Age of onset gender predisposition and clinical phenotype vary
      between each of the diseases and the clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic
      disease or unspecific symptoms such as fatigue arthralgia and pruritus to established
      cirrhosis and decompensation or also acute fulminant hepatitis and liver failure.
      Association with extrahepatic autoimmune diseases is common.
