  TextSection:
    Contents: Bosley-Salih-Alorainy syndrome (BSAS) is characterized by variable horizontal
      gaze dysfunction profound and bilateral sensorineural deafness associated commonly
      with severe inner ear maldevelopment cerebrovascular anomalies (ranging from
      unilateral internal carotid artery hypoplasia to bilateral agenesis) cardiac
      malformation developmental delay and occasionally autism. The syndrome is caused
      by homozygous mutations in the <i>HOXA1</i> gene (7p15.2) and is transmitted
      in an autosomal recessive manner. The syndrome overlaps clinically and genetically
      with Athabaskan brain dysfunction syndrome (ABDS,). However unlike ABDS BSAS
      does not manifest central hypoventilation.
