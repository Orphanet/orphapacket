  TextSection:
    Contents: Cocaine embryofetopathy is a group of clinical signs observed in newborns
      exposed <i>in utero</i> to cocaine a short-acting central nervous system stimulant
      used as a recreational drug through inhalation of the powder or intravenous
      injection. Cocaine use during pregnancy is associated with intrauterine growth
      restriction low birth weight seizures respiratory distress (decreased apnea
      density and periodic breathing) feeding difficulties irritability and lability
      of state decreased behavioral and autonomic regulation poor alertness and orientation
      and cognitive impairment (impaired auditory information processing  visual-spatial
      delay and subtle language delay) in the offspring.
