  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autoimmune disease with skin involvement characterized by recurrent
      episodes with isolated or multiple painful edematous inflammatory skin lesions
      progressing to ecchymoses within 24 hours due to autosensitization to a stromal
      component of the patient's own erythrocytes. The development of the lesions
      is usually preceded by emotional or physical stress followed by a prodromal
      stage with fatigue or malaise. Lower limbs and trunk are the most frequently
      involved sites. Accompanying features may include fever arthralgia myalgia headache
      gastrointestinal problems or hematuria and epistaxis among others. The disease
      occurs predominantly in women.
