  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-malignant adnexal neoplasm that originates from the apocrine
      or eccrine sweat glands and is characterized histologically by cystic papillary
      and ductal invaginations into the dermis lined by double-layered outer cuboidal
      and luminal high columnar epithelium and connected to the epidermis. Dilated
      capillaries and a dense infiltrate of plasma cells are characteristic. Clinically
      lesions are asymptomatic with a heterogeneous non-distinctive appearance ranging
      from skin-colored to pink papules or plaques occurring most commonly in the
      head and neck area.
