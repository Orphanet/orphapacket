  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe progressive
      sensorimotor neuropathy beginning in infancy with resulting hypotonia areflexia
      amyotrophy and variable degrees of dysgenesis of the corpus callosum. Additional
      features include mild-to-severe intellectual and developmental delays and psychiatric
      manifestations that include paranoid delusions depression hallucinations and
      'autistic-like' features. Affected individuals are usually wheelchair restricted
      in the second decade of life and die in the third decade of life. The disease
      is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
