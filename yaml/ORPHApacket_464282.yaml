  TextSection:
    Contents: Spastic paraplegia-severe developmental delay-epilepsy syndrome is a
      rare genetic complex spastic paraplegia disorder characterized by an infantile-onset
      of psychomotor developmental delay with severe intellectual disability and poor
      speech acquisition associated with seizures (mostly myoclonic) muscular hypotonia
      which may be noted at birth and slowly progressive spasticity in the lower limbs
      leading to severe gait disturbances. Ocular abnormalities and incontinence are
      commonly associated. Other symptoms may include verbal dyspraxia hypogenitalism
      macrocephaly and sensorineural hearing loss as well as dystonic movements and
      ataxia with upper limb involvement.
