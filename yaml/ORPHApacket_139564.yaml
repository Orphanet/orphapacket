  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy characterized by
      adult-onset chronic paroxysmal and dry cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux preceeding
      the neuropathy. Cough is usually triggered by noxious odors inhalation of fumes
      eating dry food lying flat or tactile stimulation of external auditory canal
      and it may progress into cough syncope. Frequent throat clearing and hoarse
      voice may also be present. Gastro-oesophageal reflux usually presents with mild
      heartburn however regurgitation and acid brash are reported in more severe cases.
      Sensory neuropathy symptoms develop later in life (between the third and fifth
      decades) with variable severities. Patients may have sensory loss in the upper
      and lower limbs lancinating pains superficial painless injuries or truncal neuropathy.
      Bilateral high frequency sensorineural hearing loss is common. Additional clinical
      features may include retinal detachment alacrima urinary urgency constipation
      and impotence. Nerve biopsy showed loss of unmyelinated and myelinated axons.
