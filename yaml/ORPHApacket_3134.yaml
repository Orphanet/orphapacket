      skeletal abnormalities (including craniostenosis pectus carinatum short sternum
      joint hyperextensibility and anbnormal vertebrae) cutis laxa with excessive
      skin folds around the cheek chin and neck ambiguous genitalia with a micropenis
      and perineal hypospadia an umbilical hernia intellectual disability premature
      aged appearance and cardiac enlargement involving either the ventricles or atria.
