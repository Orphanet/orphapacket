  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of the ocular adnexa characterized by an extended phenotype
      of blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus and telecanthus syndrome (BPES).
      When BPES is caused by a microdeletion encompassing other genes in addition
      to the causative gene <i>FOXL2</i> the patient has additional features including
      intellectual disability external genital anomaly spastic diplegia and speech
      delay. Acquired microcephaly can also be observed.
