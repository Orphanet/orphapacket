  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 3 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with high phenotypic
      variability ranging from a mild phenotype presenting joint pain and laxity mild
      facial dysmorphism (e.g. long facies prominent eyes dysplastic ears downturned
      corners of the mouth micrognathia) and no developmental delays to more severe
      phenotypes including short stature intellectual disability severe developmental
      delays additional craniofacial dysmorphic features (e.g. brachycephaly high
      forehead flat midface short neck) and hearing impairment as well as skeletal
      (e.g. pectus excavatum scoliosis) ocular (e.g. coloboma) and cardiac abnormalities.
