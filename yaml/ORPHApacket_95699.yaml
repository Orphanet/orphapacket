    Contents: A rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to P450 oxidoreductase
      deficiency and characterized by glucocorticoid deficiency virilization of external
      genitalia in females and undervirilization in males. Findings range from severely
      affected infants with 46,XX and 46,XY disorders/differences of sex development
      (DSD) and cortisol deficiency to mildly affected women who appear to have polycystic
      ovary syndrome or mildly affected men with gonadal insufficiency.
