  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage characterized by
      the presence of separate populations of blasts of more than one lineage (bilineal)
      a single population of blasts coexpressing antigens of more than one lineage
      (biphenotypic) or a combination thereof. The diagnosis relies on immunophenotyping
      the T-cell component being characterized by strong expression of cytoplasmic
      CD3 usually in the absence of surface CD3 the B-cell component expressing CD19
      almost always together with CD10 cCD79a CD22 or PAX5 while the most specific
      hallmark of the myeloid component is the presence of myeloperoxidase in the
      blast cytoplasm.
