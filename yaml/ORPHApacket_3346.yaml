  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital malformation characterized by either completely absent
      (agenesis) or severely underdeveloped (atresia) trachea. In both cases the tracheal
      lumen is absent for at least a portion of its length with no proximal-distal
      communication between the larynx and lower airways. Functionally and in terms
      of management tracheal agenesis and tracheal atresia are equivalent.
