  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bone tumor characterized by a benign cystic lesion consisting
      of blood-filled cavities divided by fibrous septa containing fibroblasts multinucleated
      osteoclast-type giant cells and reactive woven bone. The tumor may arise <i>de
      novo</i> or secondarily complicating other benign or malignant bone tumors.
      It most commonly arises during the first two decades of life and often affects
      the epiphyses of long bones and posterior elements of vertebral bodies. Patients
      typically present with pain and swelling or neurological symptoms due to compression
      of nerve roots or the spinal cord by vertebral tumors.
