  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare interstitial lung disease characterized by the coexistence of
      emphysema and usual interstitial pneumonia typically occurring in male smokers.
      Emphysema is usually encountered in the upper lobes preceding fibrosis of the
      lower lobes. Patients present with severe dyspnea and markedly reduced diffusion
      capacity on functional testing while spirometric values are relatively preserved.
      The syndrome is frequently complicated by pulmonary hypertension and acute lung
      injury.
