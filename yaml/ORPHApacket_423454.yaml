  TextSection:
    Contents: Nail and teeth abnormalities-marginal palmoplantar keratoderma-oral
      hyperpigmentation syndrome is a rare genetic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized
      by short stature nail dystrophy and/or nail loss oral mucosa and/or tongue hyperpigmentation
      dentition abnormalities (delayed teeth eruption hypodontia enamel hypoplasia)
      keratoderma on the margins of the palms and soles and focal hyperkeratosis on
      the dorsum of the hands and feet. Additionally dysphagia with esophageal strictures
      sensorineural deafness bronchial asthma and severe iron-deficiency anemia have
      been observed.
