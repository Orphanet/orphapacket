  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disease characterized by asymptomatic
      well-demarcated symmetric patches and/or plaques of finely wrinkled skin arranged
      parallel to skin cleavage lines (type I) associated with perifollicular papular
      protrusions (type II) or with persistent reticular erythema (type III) occurring
      predominantly on the shoulders trunk back and proximal extremities associating
      on histopathology a selective loss of elastic tissue in the midreticular dermis.
      Erythema and/or urticaria may or may not precede wrinkly lesions.
