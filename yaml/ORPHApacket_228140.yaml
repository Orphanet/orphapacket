  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cardiac rhythm disease characterized by ventricular fibrillation
      in the absence of any structural or functional heart disease or known repolarization
      abnormalities. The presence of J waves is associated with a higher risk of nocturnal
      ventricular fibrillation events and a higher risk of recurrence.
