    Contents: A rare genetic skeletal muscle disease characterized by neonatal to
      childhood onset of slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy primarily
      affecting the lower limbs joint contractures kyphosis or lordosis of the spine
      lateral tongue atrophy and pes equinus. Progression to upper limb involvement
      facial weakness language impairment intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities
      have been reported in addition. Muscle biopsy shows myopathic changes with increased
