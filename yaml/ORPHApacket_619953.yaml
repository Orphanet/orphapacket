  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autoinflammatory syndrome with immune deficiency characterized
      by recurrent infections (bacterial and viral) due to <i>NCKAP1L</i> mutations.
      Patients are present with recurrent respiratory tract infections and recurrent
      pneumonia mostly causing bronchiectasis bacteremia and meningitis. Patients
      also have systemic hyperinflammation which mostly presents with an atopic disease
      hepatosplenomegaly and lymphoproliferation. Cytokine overproduction antibody
      abnormalities elevated IgE levels and increased B cells are observed.
