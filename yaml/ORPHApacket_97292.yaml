  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cardiac condition characterized by severely decreased cardiac
      output hypoperfusion and end-organ dysfunction in the presence of adequate intravascular
      volume. The clinical presentation is variable and may range from subtle hemodynamic
      alterations to overt cardiovascular collapse. Commonly reported features include
      dyspnea crackles elevated jugular venous pressure altered mental state abnormal
      pulse pressure oliguria cold extremities and increased serum lactate levels.
