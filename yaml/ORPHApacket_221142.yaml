    Contents: A rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder with decreased elastic
      tissue characterized by multiple asymptomatic well demarcated flat hypopigmented
      atrophic macular skin lesions distributed over upper trunk and proximal upper
      limbs. Histopathological examination reveals atrophic epidermis with decreased
      basal pigmentation perivascular mononuclear infiltration in the upper dermis
      and disorganized hyalinized coarse collagen bundles and variable loss of elastic
      fibers in the dermis.
