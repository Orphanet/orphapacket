  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by motor cognitive
      and developmental regression with speech impairment ataxia limb weakness visual
      impairment (notably retinitis pigmentosa) dysarthria and prosopagnosia. It may
      present with congenital (the most commonly observed form of the disease) late
      infantile (3 years) and juvenile-onset (4-8 years) and later stages into adulthood.
      Congenital form is associated with immediate postnatal onset of epileptic seizures
      respiratory failure and limb hypertonia. Neonates have microcephaly with severe
      atrophy of the cerebrum and cerebellum with myelin deficiency and retinal dysfunction.
