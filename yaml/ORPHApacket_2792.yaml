  TextSection:
    Contents: Otofaciocervical syndrome is a rare genetic developmental defect during
      embryogenesis syndrome characterized by distinct facial features (long triangular
      face broad forehead narrow nose and mandible high arched palate) prominent dysmorphic
      ears (low-set and cup-shaped with large conchae and hypoplastic tragus antitragus
      and lobe) long neck preauricular and/or branchial fistulas and/or cysts hypoplastic
      cervical muscles with sloping shoulders and clavicles winged low and laterally-set
      scapulae hearing impairment and mild intellectual deficit. Vertebral defects
      and short stature may also be associated.
