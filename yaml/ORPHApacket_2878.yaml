  TextSection:
    Contents: Phocomelia-ectrodactyly-deafness-sinus arrhythmia syndrome is characterised
      by phocomelia (involving arms more severely) ectrodactyly ear anomalies (bilateral
      anomalies of the pinnae) conductive deafness dysmorphism (long and prominent
      philtrum mild maxillary hypoplasia) and sinus arrhythmia. It has been described
      in four patients (a father and his son and a mother and her daughter) from two
      unrelated families.
