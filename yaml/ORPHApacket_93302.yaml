  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare brachyolmia characterized by short stature with a high upper-to-lower
      segment ratio and relatively long arms. Mild scoliosis is typically present.
      Radiographically it is distinct from other types of brachyolmia showing rounded
      anterior and posterior vertebral margins and variable intervertebral space widths
      (narrowed or broadened). Some patients also exhibit precocious ossification
      of the falx cerebri metaphyseal irregularities and small epiphyses of the proximal
      femora. Additional clinical features may include widely spaced nipples clinodactyly
      hypoplastic nails pectus excavatum joint hyperlaxity subtle facial dysmorphism
      (such as a flat nose and thick lips) and mild intellectual disability. There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989.
