    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by neonatal hypotonia global
      developmental delay feeding difficulties and often seizures or seizure-like
      episodes. Other frequently observed signs and symptoms include variable dysmorphic
      features myopathic facies respiratory problems and visual abnormalities such
      as strabismus or esotropia. Brain imaging may show delayed myelination and other
      white matter abnormalities.
