  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked (XR) Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD;
      see this term) describes a rare group of immunodeficiencies due to specific
      mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells
      kinase gamma (<i>IKBKG</i>) or the cytochrome b-245 beta polypeptide (<i>CYBB</i>)
      genes. They are characterized by mycobacterial infections occuring in males.
