  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by the co-occurrence of a widespread
      vascular nevus (typically nevus flammeus) and a pigmentary nevus potentially
      associated with a variety of other cutaneous nevi and with or without extracutaneous
      (most commonly central nervous system ocular or musculoskeletal) involvement.
      Several subtypes are distinguished based on phenotypic characteristics.
