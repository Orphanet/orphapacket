  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic condition affecting neonates born at less than 37 weeks
      gestational age and characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction caused
      by a dysregulated host response to an infection which may have been acquired
      shortly before or during birth (resulting in early-onset neonatal sepsis during
      the first 72 hours of life) or after birth (leading to late-onset neonatal sepsis
      between 72 hours and three months). Prematurity constitutes one of the primary
      risk factors for neonatal sepsis. The clinical picture may develop gradually
      with signs and symptoms like irritability lethargy or poor feeding or progress
      rapidly to respiratory distress fever hypothermia hypotension shock and multiple
      organ failure.
