  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder with increased elastic
      tissue characterized by focal dermal elastosis and transepidermal elimination
      of abnormal elastic fibers presenting as small keratotic papules or plaques
      arranged in groups in serpiginous or annular patterns on the neck face and arms
      while other areas are less frequently affected. Although spontaneous regression
      is possible the lesions often persist over longer periods of time. The condition
      typically occurs during childhood or early adulthood and is more frequent in
      men than in women.
