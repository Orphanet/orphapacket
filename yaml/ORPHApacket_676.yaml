  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare gastroenterologic disease characterized by recurrent acute pancreatitis
      and/or chronic pancreatitis in at least 2 first-degree relatives or 3 or more
      second-degree relatives in 2 or more generations for which no predisposing factors
      are identified. This rare inherited form of pancreatitis leads to irreversible
      damage to both exocrine and endocrine components of the pancreas.
