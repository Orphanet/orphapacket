  TextSection:
    Contents: An extremely rare developmental disorder characterized by bilateral
      congenital and complete amputation of the distal extremities (amputation of
      distal epiphysis of the humerus distal portion of the tibial diaphysis aplasia
      of the radius ulna fibula) and aplasia of hands and feet (aplasia of carpal
      metacarpal tarsal metatarsal and phalangeal bones). Rarely an ectopic bone can
      be found at the distal end of the humerus. No other systemic manifestations
      have been reported and the disorder follows an autosomal recessive pattern of
      inheritance.
