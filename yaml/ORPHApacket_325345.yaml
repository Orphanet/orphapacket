  TextSection:
    Contents: 46,XY ovotesticular disorder of sex development is a rare genetic disorder
      of sex development characterized by either the coexistence of both male and
      female reproductive gonads or more frequently by the presence of one or both
      gonads containing a mixture of both testicular and ovarian tissue (ovotestes)
      in an individual with a normal male 46 XY karyotype. External genitalia are
      usually ambiguous but can range from normal male to normal female and if a uterus
      and/or fallopian tubes are present they are generally hypoplastic. Cryptorchidism
      hypospadias infertility and increased risk of gonadal tumours are frequently
      associated.
