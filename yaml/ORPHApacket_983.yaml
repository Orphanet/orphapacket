  TextSection:
    Contents: Testicular regression syndrome (TRS) is a developmental anomaly characterized
      by the absence of one or both testicles with partial or complete absence of
      testicular tissue. TRS may vary from normal male with unilateral no-palpable
      testis through phenotypic male with micropenis to phenotypic female. The phenotype
      depends on the extent and timing of the intrauterine accident in relation to
      sexual development.
