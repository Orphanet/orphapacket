    Contents: Osteopetrosis-hypogammaglobulinemia syndrome is an extremely rare primary
      bone dysplasia with increased bone density disorder characterized by severe
      osteoclast-poor osteopetrosis associated with hypogammaglobulinemia. Patients
      typically present infantile malignant osteopetrosis (manifesting with increased
      bone density bone fractures abnormal eye movements/visual loss nystagmus) hematologic
      abnormalities with bone marrow failure (e.g. anemia hepatosplenomegaly) and
      immunological deficiency (manifesting as recurrent respiratory infections) associated
      with reduced immunoglobulin levels due to impaired peripheral B cell differentiation.
