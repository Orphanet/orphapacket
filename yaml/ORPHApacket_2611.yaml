  Synonyms:

  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by a hamartomatous epidermal lesion
      presenting as a linear array of verrucous hyperkeratotic papules that often
      coalesce into plaques and are formed along the lines of Blaschko. The condition
      is associated with involvement of other organ systems mainly brain eye and skeletal
      system. It is the result of mosaic post-zygotic mutations and most commonly
      presents at birth but may occur anytime during childhood rarely also in adulthood.
