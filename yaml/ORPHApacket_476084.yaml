  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
      characterized by atrioventricular block resulting in repeated syncope episodes
      elevated creatine kinase serum levels and adult-onset of slowly progressive
      proximal limb skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. Muscular dystrophic changes
      observed in muscle biopsy include diameter variability increased central nuclei
      and presence of necrotic and regenerating fibers.
