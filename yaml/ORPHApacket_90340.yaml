  TextSection:
    Contents: Blau syndrome (BS) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease characterized
      by early onset granulomatous arthritis uveitis and skin rash. BS now refers
      to both the familial and sporadic (formerly early-onset sarcoidosis) form of
      the same disease. The proposed term pediatric granulomatous arthritis is currently
      questioned since it fails to represent the systemic nature of the disease.
