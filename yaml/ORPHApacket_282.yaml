  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprises a group of neurodegenerative
      disorders characterized by progressive changes in behavior executive dysfunction
      and language impairment as a result of degeneration of the medial prefrontal
      and frontoinsular cortices. Four clinical subtypes have been identified: semantic
      dementia progressive non-fluent aphasia behavioral variant FTD and right temporal
      lobar atrophy (see these terms).'
