  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired neutropenia characterized by isolated neutropenia in
      a newborn due to maternal alloimmunization against human neutrophil antigens
      (HNA) inherited from the father and present on fetal neutrophils and subsequent
      increased breakdown of the latter. The condition is self-limiting and resolves
      after several weeks. It usually presents with only mild bacterial infections
      or may even be asymptomatic although severe forms with sepsis and fatal outcome
      have also been reported.
