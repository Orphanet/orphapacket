    Contents: A congenital X-linked clinical subtype of L1 syndrome characterized
      by severe hydrocephalus often of prenatal onset adducted thumbs spasticity (mostly
      evidenced by brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses) and severe
      intellectual disability. This subtype represents the severe end of the L1 syndrome
      spectrum and is associated with poor prognosis.
