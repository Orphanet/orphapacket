  TextSection:
    Contents: A congenital X-linked clinical subtype of L1 syndrome characterized
      by severe hydrocephalus often of prenatal onset adducted thumbs spasticity (mostly
      evidenced by brisk tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses) and moderate
      to severe intellectual disability. This subtype represents the severe end of
      the L1 syndrome spectrum and is associated with poor prognosis.
