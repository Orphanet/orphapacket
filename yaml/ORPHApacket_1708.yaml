    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 16 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype ranging from minor anomalies with normal development to intrauterine
      growth retardation abnormal skin pigmentation craniofacial and body asymmetry
      cardiac (e.g. ventricular septal defect) and genital (e.g. hypospadias cryptorchidism)
      anomalies scoliosis and hearing loss to neonatal death. Additional features
      observed include skeletal malformations (e.g. clino/polydactyly talipes) mild
      facial dysmorphism and developmental delay.
