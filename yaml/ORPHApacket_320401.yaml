  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 44 (SPG44) is a very rare
      complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by a late-onset
      slowly progressive spastic paraplegia associated with mild ataxia and dysarthria
      upper extremity involvement (i.e. loss of finger dexterity dysmetria) and mild
      cognitive impairment without the presence of nystagmus. A hypomyelinating leukodystrophy
      and thin corpus callosum is observed in all cases and psychomotor development
      is normal or near normal. SPG44 is caused by mutations in the <i>GJC2</i> gene
      (1q41-q42) encoding the gap junction gamma-2 protein.
