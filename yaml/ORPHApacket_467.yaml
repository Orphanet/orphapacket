  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare disorders characterized by multiple pituitary hormone
      deficiencies including somatotropin thyrotropin lactotropin corticotropin and
      gonadotropin deficiencies due to mutations of pituitary transcription factors
      involved in pituitary ontogenesis. Clinical presentation varies depending on
      the type and severity of the deficiencies as well as the age at diagnosis. If
      left untreated the main symptoms include short stature cognitive impairment
      and delayed puberty.
