  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome associated with infection and
      characterized by a biphasic clinical course. The initial symptom is a prolonged
      febrile seizure on day 1 (the first phase). Afterwards patients have variable
      levels of consciousness from normal to coma. Irrespective of the consciousness
      levels magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 2 days shows no abnormality.
      During the second phase (usually days 4 - 6) patients show a cluster of seizures
      and deterioration of consciousness. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) on MRI reveal
      the brain lesions with reduced diffusion predominantly in the subcortical white
      matter. After the second acute phase consciousness levels improve with the emerging
      focal neurological signs. Neurological outcomes of AESD vary from normal to
      mild or severe sequelae including cerebral atrophy mental retardation paralysis
      and epilepsy.
