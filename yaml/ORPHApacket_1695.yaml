  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-distal trisomy 10q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 10 characterized
      by mild to moderate developmental delay postnatal growth retardation central
      hypotonia craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. microcephaly prominent forehead flat
      thick ear helices deep-set small eyes epicanthus upturned nose bow-shaped mouth
      highly arched palate micrognathia) ocular anomalies (e.g. iris coloboma retinal
      dysplasia strabismus) long slender limbs and skeletal and digital anomalies
      (scoliosis poly/syndactyly). Additional features reported include cardiac defects
      (e.g. septal ventricular defect) anal atresia and cryptorchidism.
