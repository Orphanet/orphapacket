  TextSection:
    Contents: Lemierre syndrome is a rare potentially lethal oropharyngeal infectious
      disease occurring in immunocompetent adolescents and young adults that is mainly
      due to <i>Fusobacterium necrophorum</i> and that is characterized by septic
      thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein that leads to septic usually pulmonary
      embolism associated with ENT (ear nose and throat) infection that manifests
      with fever neck pain and tonsillopharyngitis.
