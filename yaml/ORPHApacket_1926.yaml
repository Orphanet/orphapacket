  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare teratologic disease characterized by a range of congenital anomalies
      associated with poorly controlled maternal diabetes frequently including abnormalities
      of the cardiovascular or central nervous system as well as other organ systems
      such as skeletal and craniofacial systems. In addition to embryopathy uncontrolled
      maternal diabetes can lead to fetal/neonatal complications (including metabolic
      respiratory or delivery complications).
