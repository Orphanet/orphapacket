    Contents: 'Creatine deficiency syndrome (CDS) comprises a group of inborn errors
      of creatine metabolism characterized by a global developmental delay intellectual
      disability and associated neurological (seizures movement disorders myopathy)
      and behavioral manifestions. CDS includes two creatine biosynthesis disorders;
      guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency and L- Arginine: glycine amidinotransferase
      deficiency as well as X-linked creatine transporter deficiency.'
