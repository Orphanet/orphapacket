  TextSection:
    Contents: Optic pathway glioma (OPG) is a benign tumor that develop along the
      optic nerve (chiasm tracts and radiations) characterized by impairment or loss
      of vision and may be accompanied by diencephalic symptoms such as reduced growth
      and alteration in sleeping patterns. OPG are often linked to neurofibromatosis
      type 1 (NF1 see this term).
