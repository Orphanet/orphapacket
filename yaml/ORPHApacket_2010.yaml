    Contents: Cleft palate - stapes fixation - oligodontia is characterized by cleft
      soft palate severe oligodontia of the deciduous teeth absence of the permanent
      dentition bilateral conductive deafness due to fixation of the footplate of
      the stapes short halluces with a wide space between the first and second toes
      and fusion of carpal and tarsal bones. It has been described in two sisters
      of Swedish extraction. An autosomal recessive mode of inheritance is likely.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1971.
