  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by severe intrauterine and
      postnatal growth retardation and short stature in association with craniofacial
      dysmorphism (such as large forehead triangular face low-set ears and micro-retrognathism)
      and osteochondrodysplastic lesions. Radiographic findings include epiphyseal
      maturation delay abnormal metaphyses a narrow thorax small pelvis and short
      and broad metacarpal bones and phalanges. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1996.
