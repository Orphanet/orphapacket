  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngologic disease characterized by an indolent submucosal
      mass of variable size and extent most commonly arising in the anterior nasal
      cavity involving the nasal septum and lateral nasal wall and potentially extending
      into the adjacent sinuses. Occurrence in the larynx and lower respiratory tract
      or the orbit is rare. Histological examination shows concentric angiocentric
      stromal fibrosis (onionskin fibrosis) and prominent eosinophils. Increased numbers
      of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the lesion may also be observed in addition
      to elevated serum IgG4. Patients typically present with long-standing obstructive
      symptoms.
