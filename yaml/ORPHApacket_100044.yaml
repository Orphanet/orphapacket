  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by intermediate
      motor median nerve conduction velocities (usually between 25 and 45 m/s) and
      signs of both demyelination and axonal degeneration in nerve biopsies. It presents
      with mild to moderately severe slowly progressive usual clinical features of
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (muscle weakness and atrophy of the distal extremities
      distal sensory loss reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes and feet deformities).
      Other findings include asymptomatic neutropenia and early-onset cataracts.
