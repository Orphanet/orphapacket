  TextSection:
    Contents: Spastic paraplegia-precocious puberty syndrome is a complex form of
      hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by the onset of progressive spastic
      paraplegia associated with precocious puberty (due to Leydig cell hyperplasia)
      in childhood (at the age of 2 years). Moderate intellectual disability was also
      reported. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1983.
