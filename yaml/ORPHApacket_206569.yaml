  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by acute
      or subacute severe symmetrical proximal muscle weakness usually associated with
      muscle-specific antibodies (anti-HMGCR or anti-SRP). Histopathological characteristics
      include myocyte necrosis and regeneration without significant inflammation and
      C5b-9 deposition on non-necrotic myofibers.
