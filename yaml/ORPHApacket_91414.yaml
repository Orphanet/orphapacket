  TextSection:
    Contents: Pilomatrixoma is a rare and benign hair cell-derived tumor occurring
      mostly in young adults (usually under the age of 20) and characterized as a
      3-30 mm solitary painless firm mobile deep dermal or subcutaneous tumor most
      commonly found in the head neck or upper extremities. When superficial the tumors
      tint the skin blue-red. Multiple pilomatrixomas are seen in myotonic dystrophy
      Gardner syndrome Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome and Turner syndrome (see these terms).
