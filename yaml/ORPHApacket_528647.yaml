  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary angioedema characterized by potentially life-threatening
      episodes of subcutaneous and/or submucosal edema without urticaria and with
      normal levels and function of C1 esterase inhibitor. Patients present with prolonged
      attacks which last for approximately two to five days and may include nonpitting
      edema of the skin severe abdominal symptoms such as pain and swelling and/or
      respiratory distress due to upper respiratory airways involvement. Affected
      locations and frequency of attacks differ slightly between subtypes. Estrogen-containing
      oral contraceptives and pregnancy are precipitating factors especially in patients
      with a factor XII mutation.
