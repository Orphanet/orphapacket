  TextSection:
    Contents: A tumor of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues characterized by the most
      common AML-causing MLL translocation resulting in the MLL-MLLT3-fusion protein.
      It can occur either as a primary neoplasm or secondary to previous chemo-/radiation
      therapy. Clinical manifestations result from accumulation of malignant myeloid
      cells within the bone marrow peripheral blood and other organs and include leukocytosis
      anemia thrombocytopenia fever bone pain fatigue pallor easy bruising and frequent
      bleeding.
