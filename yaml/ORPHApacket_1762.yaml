  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked genomic disorder associated with interstitial chromosomal
      duplications at Xq28 encompassing the <i>MECP2</i> gene. It is characterized
      in males by infantile onset hypotonia severe global developmental delay intellectual
      disability progressive spasticity seizures gastrointestinal symptoms and recurrent
      respiratory infections. In females the phenotype is more variable.
