  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare adrenal Cushing syndrome characterized by bilateral benign adrenal
      macronodules (>1 cm) that potentially produce autonomously variable levels of
      cortisol excess. Although in most cases are ACTH-independent non-suppressed
      ACTH levels have been described.
