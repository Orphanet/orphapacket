    Contents: A rare intestinal disease characterized by a single focal intestinal
      perforation associated with hemorrhagic necrosis typically occurring at the
      terminal ileum involving antimesenteric border. It may also occur in the jejunum
      or colon. It predominantly affects very (or extremely) low weight infants (birth
      weight less than 1500&nbsp;g) mostly in the first week of life. Patients have
      healthy bowel apart from the perforation site they present with bluish discoloration
      and gasless abdomen in the absence of pneumatosis intestinalis. Urinary tract
      infection can also be present. However they do not manifest necrotizing enterocolitis
      bowel obstruction or prodromal clinical symptoms.
