  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired immunodeficiency disease characterized by adult-onset
      absolute neutrophil counts less than 1.5 x 10^9/L on at least 3 occasions in
      a 3 month period that cannot be attributable to drugs or a specific genetic
      infectious inflammatory autoimmune or malignant cause. Recurrent aphtous stomatitis
      and a history of mild bacterial infections are typically associated. A benign
      outcome with a low rate of severe infections and no secondary malignancies is
      observed.
