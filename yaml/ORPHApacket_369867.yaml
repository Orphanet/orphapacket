    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal recessive intermediate Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      (CMT) disease characterized by childhood to adulthood-onset of progressive moderate
      to severe predominantly distal mostly lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy
      foot deformities (including pes cavus and hammer toes) absent deep tendon reflexes
      and distal sensory loss associated with decreased motor and sensory nerve conduction
      velocities and features of both demyelinating and axonal neuropathy on sural
      nerve biopsy.
