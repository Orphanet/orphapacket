  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare arthrogryposis syndromes characterized by congenital
      contractures of two or more areas of the body primarily involving the hands
      and feet while the proximal joints are largely spared in the absence of primary
      neurologic and/or muscle disease affecting limb function. Diagnostic features
      include camptodactyly or pseudocamptodactyly hypoplastic or absent flexion creases
      overriding fingers ulnar deviation at the wrist talipes equinovarus calcaneovalgus
      deformities vertical talus and/or metatarsus varus.
