  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired retinal disorder characterised by sequential focal degeneration
      of photoreceptors retinal pigment epithelium and choroid with the majority of
      patients experiencing sudden onset photopsia and acute scotomas. Although patients
      typically retain decent visual acuity blind spot enlargement and retinal pigment
      epithelial disturbances tend to develop over time. Individuals also often complain
      of distortion of central vision photophobia and difficulty with night vision
      with more advanced cases reporting loss of peripheral vision.
