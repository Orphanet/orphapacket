    Contents: A rare non-syndromic uterine malformation characterized by a uterus
      with two uterine horns and only one cervix resulting from a failure in the fusion
      of the two Müllerian structures. Depending on the degree of the fusion deficiency
      the malformation may be complete with the cavities separated up to the internal
      orifice of the cervix and not linked or partial when there is some linkage.
      Patients may present recurrent pregnancy loss or preterm labor.
