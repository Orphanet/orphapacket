  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ciliopathy characterized by congenital moderate-to-severe deafness
      retinitis pigmentosa developing in the first or second decade and normal vestibular
      function. Congenital bilateral sensorineural hearing loss is mild to moderate
      in the low frequencies and severe to profound in the higher frequencies. Additional
      manifestations include night blindness constricted visual field (tunnel vision)
      and later on decreased visual acuity sometimes ending with bare light perception.
