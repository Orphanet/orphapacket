  TextSection:
    Contents: An X-linked syndromic muti-systemic ectodermal dysplasia presenting
      neonatally in females with a bullous rash along Blaschko's lines (BL) followed
      by verrucous plaques and hyperpigmented swirling patterns. It is further characterized
      by teeth abnormalities alopecia nail dystrophy and can affect the retinal and
      the central nervous system (CNS) microvasculature. It may have other aspects
      of ectodermal dysplasia such as sweat gland abnormalities. Germline pathogenic
      variants in males result in embryonic lethality.
