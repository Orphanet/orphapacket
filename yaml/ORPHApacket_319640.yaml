      disorder characterized by slowly progressive ''bull's eye'' maculopathy associated
      in most cases with mild decrease in visual acuity and central scotomata. Usually
      only the central retina is involved however some cases of more widespread rod
      and cone anomalies have been reported. Rare additional features include empty
