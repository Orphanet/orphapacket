  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic renal tubular disease characterized by progressive outgrowths
      of fluid-filled cysts from the renal epithelium which can manifest with hematuria
      urinary tract infections hypertension and abdominal or flank pain. The slowly
      progressive loss of kidney function may evolve to end stage kidney disease (ESKD).
