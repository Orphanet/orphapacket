  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neoplastic disease characterized by occurrence of atypical and
      aggressive gastric type 1 neuroendocrine tumors (NET) in early adulthood. The
      tumors often show nodal infiltration requiring total gastrectomy. Synchronous
      gastric adenocarcinoma has also been reported. Patients present high serum gastrin
      concentrations and iron-deficiency anemia (rather than megaloblastic anemia
      which is a typical feature in patients with sporadic gastric type 1 NET where
      the tumor usually arises on the background of autoimmune atrophic gastritis).
