    Contents: X-linked severe congenital neutropenia is an immunodeficiency syndrome
      characterized by recurrent major bacterial infections severe congenital neutropenia
      and monocytopenia. It has been described in five males spanning three generations
      of one family. It is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait and is caused
      by mutations in the <i>WAS</i> gene encoding the WASP protein.
