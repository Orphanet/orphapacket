  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital myopathy characterized ultrastructurally by the presence
      of tubular aggregates in the subsarcolemmal region of the muscle fiber. It most
      commonly presents with slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness predominantly
      of the lower limbs periodic paralysis post-exertion muscle cramps and muscular
      pain. Ocular anomalies like ophthalmoplegia or pupillary abnormalities may be
      associated. The intensity of the symptoms is variable cases with normal muscle
      strength but myalgia or fatigue as well as clinically asymptomatic cases have
      been described.
