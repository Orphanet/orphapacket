    Contents: X small rings is a rare chromosome X structural anomaly with highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by developmental delay intellectual
      disability short stature craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. microcephaly facial
      asymmetry hypertelorism long palpebral fissures epicanthus low-set or malrotated
      ears broad nose with a flat nasal bridge anteverted nares long philtrum thin
      upper lip high arched palate micrognathia) and skeletal anomalies (e.g. cubitus
      valgus talipes equinovarus). Patients may also present heart malformations (e.g.
      ventricular septal defects mitral valve stenosis) sacral dimple soft tissue
