  TextSection:
    Contents: Supratip dysplasia is a rare congenital non-syndromic nose and cavum
      malformation characterized by the presence of a bulbous soft tissue hypertrophy
      located in the middle-to-distal third of the nasal dorsum in association with
      deformed slightly laterally- and caudally-placed nasal alae and a scar-like
      atrophic skin lesion located at the nasal tip. Respiratory function is not affected.
