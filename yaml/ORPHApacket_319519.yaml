  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 14 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      neonatal or infancy-onset of seizures that are refractory to treatment delayed
      or absent psychomotor development and lactic acidosis. Additional manifestations
      reported include poor feeding failure to thrive microcephaly hypotonia anemia
      and thrombocytopenia.
