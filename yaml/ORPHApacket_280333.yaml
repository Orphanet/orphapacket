  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by slowly-progressive
      mainly proximal muscle weakness presenting in early childhood (with difficulties
      walking and climbing stairs) and mild to severe intellectual disability. Additional
      manifestations reported include microcephaly mild increase in thigh or calf
      muscles and contractures of the ankles.
