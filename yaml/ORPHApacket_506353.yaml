  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by progressive spastic
      paraparesis and delayed gross motor development with an onset in infancy or
      early childhood. Patients also show variable degrees of intellectual disability
      speech delay and dysarthria. Other reported features include microcephaly seizures
      bifid uvula with or without cleft palate and ocular anomalies. Brain imaging
      shows white matter abnormalities in the periventricular and other regions.
