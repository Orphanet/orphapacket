    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by the association of
      common variable immunodeficiency manifesting with hypogammaglobulinemia and
      recurrent or severe childhood-onset sinopulmonary infections followed possibly
      many years later by symptomatic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency
      resulting from anterior pituitary hormone deficiency.
