  TextSection:
    Contents: Cutis gyrata-acanthosis nigricans-craniosynostosis syndrome also known
      as Beare-Stevenson syndrome (BSS) is a severe form of syndromic craniosynostosis
      characterized by a variable degree of craniosynostosis with cloverleaf skull
      reported in over 50% of cases cutis gyrata corduroy-like linear striations in
      the skin acanthosis nigricans skin tags and choanal stenosis or atresia). Additional
      features include facial features similar to Crouzon disease ear defects (conductive
      hearing loss posteriorly angulated ears stenotic auditory canals preauricular
      furrows and narrow ear canals) hirsutism a prominent umbilical stump and genitorurinary
      anomalies (anteriorly placed anus hypoplasic labia hypospadias). BSS is associated
      with a poor outcome as patients present an elevated risk for sudden death in
      their first year of life. Significant developmental delay and intellectual disability
      are observed in most patients who survive infancy.
