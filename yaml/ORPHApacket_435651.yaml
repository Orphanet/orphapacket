  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic lipodystrophy characterized by abnormal subcutaneous
      fat distribution resulting in preservation of visceral neck and axilliary fat
      and absence of lower limb and femorogluteal subcutaneous fat. Additional clinical
      features are acanthosis nigricans insulin-resistant type II diabetes mellitus
      dyslipidemia and hypertension leading to pancreatitis hepatomegaly and hepatic
      steatosis.
