  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 14 is a rare chromosomal anomaly disorder with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by growth and developmental delay
      intellectual disability body asymmetry/hypotonia congenital heart defects genitourinary
      abnormalities (cryptorchidism micropenis large clitoris labial swelling) and
      abnormal skin hyperpigmentation. Patients usually present with craniofacial
      dysmorphism such as microcephaly abnormal palpebral fissure hypertelorism ear
      abnormalities broad nose low-set ears micro/retro-gnathia and cleft or highly
      arched palate.
