    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 14 is a rare chromosomal anomaly disorder with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by growth and developmental delay
      intellectual disability body asymmetry/hypotonia congenital heart defects genitourinary
      abnormalities (cryptorchidism micropenis large clitoris labial swelling) and
