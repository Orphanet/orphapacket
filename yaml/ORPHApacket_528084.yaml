    Contents: A rare genetic intellectual disability characterized by the association
      of intellectual disability with variable other anomalies in the absence of a
      well-characterized syndrome. Associated abnormalities may include facial dysmorphism
      neurological signs and symptoms behavioral problems and abnormalities of various
      other organ systems.
