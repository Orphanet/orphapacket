  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptodactyly syndrome Guadalajara type 3 is a rare genetic bone development
      disorder characterized by hand camptodactyly associated with facial dysmorphism
      (flat face hypertelorism telecanthus symblepharon simplified ears retrognathia)
      and neck anomalies (short neck with stricking pterygia muscle sclerosis). Additional
      features include spinal defects (e.g. cervical and dorso-lumbar spina bifida
      occulta) congenital shortness of the sternocleidomastoid muscle flexed wrists
      and thin hands and feet. Brain structural anomalies multiple nevi micropenis
      and mild intellectual disability are also observed. Imaging reveals increased
      bone traveculae cortical thickening of long bones and delayed bone age.
