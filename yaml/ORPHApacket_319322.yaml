  TextSection:
    Contents: Mucinous tubular and spindle cell renal carcinoma is a rare subtype
      of renal cell carcinoma characterized histologically by tubular architecture
      and sheets of spindle cells embedded in a mucinous/myxoid stroma and macroscopically
      by a solid generally well-circumscribed partially encapsulated tumor of variable
      size with a homogenously colored bulging cut surface occassionally containing
      areas of hemorrhage or necrosis usually located in the cortex. Patients can
      present abdominal/flank pain adbominal mass and/or hematuria however most are
      asymptomatic and tumor is discovered incidentally. Indolent behavior is frequent
      and association with nephrolithiasis and end-stage kidney disease has been noted.
