  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic form of lissencephaly characterized by severe microcephaly
      agyria agenesis of the corpus callosum cerebellar hypoplasia facial dysmorphology
      and epiphyseal stippling of the metacarpal bones. The syndrome may be an allelic
      variant of Neu-Laxova syndrome and Lissencephaly type III with cystic dilations
      of the cerebellum and foetal akinesia sequence.
