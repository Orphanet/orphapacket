  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare spotted fever rickettsiosis caused by infection with the tick-borne
      bacterium <i>Rickettsia conorii</i> characterized by the onset of fever after
      an incubation period of about a week followed by a centripetally spreading maculopapular
      rash which may evolve into a petechial form. Accompanying symptoms are headaches
      myalgia and/or arthralgia among others. The typical ''tache noire'' may be observed
      at the site of the tick bite for several days. The disease is endemic in Africa
      Southern Europe and India.
