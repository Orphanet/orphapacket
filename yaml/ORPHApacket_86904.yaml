    Contents: Methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorders are rare immunodeficiency-associated
      lymphoproliferative diseases characterized by lymphoid proliferation or lymphomas
      (large B-cell lymphoma T-cell lymphoma Hodgkin lymphoma reactive lymphadenitis
      and a polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder) that develop
      in patients with different autoimmune diseases treated with methotrexate. Swelling
      is the predominant manifestation of the disease and regression after methotrexate
