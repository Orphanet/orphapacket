  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized
      by life-threatening infections due to disrupted transferrin receptor 1 endocytosis
      resulting in defective cellular iron transport and impaired T and B cell function.
      Patients present with early-onset chronic diarrhea severe recurrent infections
      and failure to thrive. Laboratory studies reveal hypo- or agammaglobulinemia
      normal lymphocyte counts but decreased numbers of memory B cells intermittent
      neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and mild anemia (resistant to iron supplementation)
      with low mean corpuscular volume.
