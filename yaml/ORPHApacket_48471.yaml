  TextSection:
    Contents: The term lissencephaly covers a group of rare malformations sharing
      the common feature of anomalies in the appearance of brain convolutions (characterised
      by simplification or absence of folding) associated with abnormal organisation
      of the cortical layers as a result of neuronal migration defects during embryogenesis.
