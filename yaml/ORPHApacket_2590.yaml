  TextSection:
    Contents: Spinal muscular atrophy-progressive myoclonic epilepsy syndrome is characterized
      by hereditary myoclonus and progressive distal muscular atrophy. Less than 10
      cases have been reported. Treatment with clonazepam results in complete and
      lasting improvement of the myoclonus.
