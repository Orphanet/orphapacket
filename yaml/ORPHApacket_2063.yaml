  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dysostosis syndrome characterized by abnormal fusion of the spleen
      with the gonad (or more rarely with remnants of the mesonephros) limb abnormalities
      (consisting of amelia or severe reduction defects leading to upper and/or lower
      rudimentary limbs) and orofacial abnormalities such as cleft palate bifid uvula
      microglossia and mandibular hypoplasia. It could also be associated with other
      malformations such as cryptorchidism anal stenosis/atresia hypoplastic lungs
      and cardiac malformations.
