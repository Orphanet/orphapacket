    Contents: Severe hypotonia-psychomotor developmental delay-strabismus-cardiac
      septal defect syndrome is a rare genetic non-dystrophic congenital myopathy
      disorder characterized by a neonatal-onset of severe generalized hypotonia associated
      with mild psychomotor delay congenital strabismus with abducens nerve palsy
      and atrial and/or ventricular septal defects. Cryptorchidism is commonly reported
      in male patients and muscle biopsy typically reveals increased variability in
      muscle fiber size.
