  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by neurodevelopmental
      delay impaired motor and language skills progressive dementia visual deterioration
      extrapyramidal signs progressive gait dysfunction seizures and brain atrophy.
      It may present rarely with infantile (2-18 months) classically late infantile
      (2-4 years) and juvenile-onset (6-10 years). Infantile-onset and late infantile-onset
      patients are reported to have rapid disease progression leading to complete
      loss of motor function within 6 years and may be fatal whereas juvenile onset
      patients were reported to have milder clinical features including mild learning
      disability behavior abnormalities associated with dementia and progressive cognitive
      function regression. Extrapyramidal cerebellar signs retinal degeneration and
      vision loss may be observed later in the adulthood. This form is most frequently
      observed in Southern Europe.
