  TextSection:
    Contents: TARP syndrome is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome
      characterized by Robin sequence (micrognathia glossoptosis and cleft palate)
      atrial septal defect persistence of the left superior vena cava and talipes
      equinovarus. The phenotype is variable some patients present with further dysmorphic
      characteristics (e.g. hypertelorism ear abnormalities) while others do not have
      any key findings. Additional features such as syndactyly polydactyly or brain
      anomalies (e.g. cerebellar hypoplasia) have also been reported. The syndrome
      is almost invariably lethal with affected males either dying prenatally or living
      just a few months.
