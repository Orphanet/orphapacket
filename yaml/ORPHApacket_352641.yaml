  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by childhood
      or adolescent-onset of cerebellar ataxia with dysarthria which slowly progresses
      and associates pyramidal signs including lower limb spasticity brisk reflexes
      and Babinski and Hoffman signs. Patients typically present cerebellar ataxia
      with development of increasing asymmetric spasticity in upper and lower limbs
      and variable axonal sensory or sensorimotor neuropathy. Additional heterogeneous
      features including pes cavus scoliolis and abnormalities of the brain (e.g.
      cerebral atrophy) may also be associated.
