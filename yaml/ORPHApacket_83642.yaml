  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare constitutional anemia with liver iron overload characterized
      by severe hypochromic microcytic anemia present at birth and hepatic iron overload
      due to a defect in iron transport to erythroid cells. Patients are present with
      erythroid hyperplasia with signs of abnormal erythroid maturation consistently
      high serum iron levels and serum transferrin receptors.
