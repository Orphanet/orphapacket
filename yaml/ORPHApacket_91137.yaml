  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a group of very rare glomerular
      diseases composed of immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG) and non-amyloid fibrillary
      glomerulopathy (non-amyloid FGP) that are characterized by mesangial deposition
      of monoclonal microtubular or polyclonal fibrillar deposits. Both present clinically
      with nephrotic range proteinuria hematuria and renal insufficiency leading to
      renal failure in many cases. ITG is more likely to manifest with underlying
      lymphoproliferative disease hypocomplementemia dysproteinemia monoclonal gammopathy
      or occult cryoglobulinemia. Non-amyloid FGP is 10 times more frequent than ITG.
