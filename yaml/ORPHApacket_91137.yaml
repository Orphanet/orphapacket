  TextSection:
    Contents: Immunotactoid or fibrillary glomerulopathy is a group of very rare glomerular
      diseases composed of immunotactoid glomerulopathy (ITG) and non-amyloid fibrillary
      glomerulopathy (non-amyloid FGP) (see these terms) that are characterized by
      mesangial deposition of monoclonal microtubular or polyclonal fibrillar deposits.
      Both present clinically with nephrotic range proteinuria hematuria and renal
      insufficiency leading to renal failure in many cases. ITG is more likely to
      manifest with underlying lymphoproliferative disease hypocomplementemia dysproteinemia
      monoclonal gammopathy or occult cryoglobulinemia. Non-amyloid FGP is 10 times
      more frequent than ITG.
