  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by the association of developmental delay and mild chondrodysplasia with short
      stature and abnormal growth plate morphology. Dysmorphic facial features are
      variable and may include hypertelorism upslanting palpebral fissures broad nose
      with broad nasal tip and low-set cup-shaped ears among others. Autism spectrum
      disorder and neurologic abnormalities have also been reported.
