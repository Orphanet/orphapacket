  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of leukodystrophy that is characterized by infantile-onset macrocephaly
      often with mild neurologic signs at presentation (such as mild motor delay)
      which worsen with time leading to poor ambulation falls ataxia spasticity increasing
      seizures and cognitive decline. Brain magnetic resonance imaging reveals diffusely
      abnormal and mildly swollen white matter as well as subcortical cysts in the
      anterior temporal and frontoparietal regions.
