    Contents: Spastic ataxia-corneal dystrophy syndrome is a rare hereditary ataxia
      disorder characterized by the presence of spastic ataxia in association with
      bilateral congenital cataract macular corneal dystrophy (stromal with deposition
      of mucoid material) and nonaxial myopia. Patients present normal intellectual
      development. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1986.
