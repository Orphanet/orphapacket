  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary ataxia disorder characterized by the presence of spastic
      ataxia in association with bilateral congenital cataract macular corneal dystrophy
      (stromal with deposition of mucoid material) and nonaxial myopia. Patients present
      normal intellectual development. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1986.
