  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary form of mineralocorticoid resistance characterized by
      mild to profound salt wasting either restricted to the kidney (renal pseudohypoaldosteronism
      type 1) or generalized affecting many organs (generalized pseudohypoaldosteronism
      type 1). Clinical presentation is in the neonatal period with failure to thrive
      vomiting and dehydration with biochemical findings of hyperkalaemia metabolic
      acidosis and elevated plasma aldosterone and renin concentration.
