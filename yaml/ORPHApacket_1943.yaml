  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by early-onset progressive
      encephalopathy with migrant continuous myoclonus. The focal continuous myoclonus
      (lasting from dozens of minutes to hours) is observed in the first months of
      life. During disease progression prolonged bilateral myoclonic seizures and
      generalized tonic-clonic seizures occur and eventually progressive encephalopathy
      with hypotonia and ataxia is observed. All patients reported to have cortical
      atrophy. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1996.
