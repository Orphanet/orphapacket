  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterized by early-onset progressive encephalopathy
      with migrant continuous myoclonus. Three cases have been reported. The focal
      continuous myoclonus appeared during the first months of life. Prolonged bilateral
      myoclonic seizures and generalized tonic-clonic seizures occurred later. Subsequently
      a progressive encephalopathy with hypotonia and ataxia appeared. Cortical atrophy
      was revealed by computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI). The aetiology is unknown.
