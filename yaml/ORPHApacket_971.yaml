  TextSection:
    Contents: A spectrum of congenital malformative disorders characterized by the
      co-occurrence of distal limb anomalies (usually bilateral cleft feet and/or
      hands) and renal defects (e.g. unilateral or bilateral agenesis) that can be
      associated with a variety of other anomalies such as those of genitourinary
      tract (genital anomalies ureteral hypoplasias vesicoureteral reflux) abdominal
      well defects intestinal atresias and lung malformations. Familial cases have
      been reported in which an autosomal recessive inheritance was suspected.
