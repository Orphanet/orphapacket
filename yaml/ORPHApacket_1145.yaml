  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of spinal muscular atrophy characterized by the neonatal
      onset of severe hypotonia areflexia profound weakness multiple congenital contractures
      facial dysmorphic features (myopathic face with open tent-shaped mouth) cryptorchidism
      and mild skeletal abnormalities (i.e. kyphosis scoliosis) that is often preceded
      by polyhydramnios and reduced fetal movements <i>in utero</i> and followed by
      bone fractures shortly after birth. Muscle weakness is progressive and chest
      muscle involvement eventually leads to ventilatory insufficiency and respiratory
      failure.
