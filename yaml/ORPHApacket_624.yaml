  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial multiple nevi flammei is a rare genetic capillary malformation
      disorder characterized by dark red to purple birthmarks which manifest as flat
      sharply circumscribed cutaneous lesions typically situated in the head and neck
      region in various members of a single family. The lesions grow proportionally
      with the individual change in color and often thicken with age.
