    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant hereditary demyelinating motor and sensory
      neuropathy characterized by progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy distal
      sensory impairment and decreased or absent reflexes in the affected limbs with
      an onset in the first or second decade of life. Median motor nerve conduction
      velocities are typically less than 38 m/s. Patients often have foot deformities.
      Sural nerve biopsy shows decrease in myelinated fibers myelin abnormalities
      and onion bulb formation. Fatty replacement of muscle tissue predominantly affects
      the anterior and lateral compartment of the lower legs.
