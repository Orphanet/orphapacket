    Contents: A rare primary combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized
      by early-onset of recurrent invasive viral and bacterial infections associated
      with T and B cell lymphopenia functional defects in T and B cells poor antibody
      response and thrombocytopenia. Depending on the type of infectious agent variable
      clinical manifestations commonly include recurrent pneumonia bronchiolitis otitis
      media meningoencephalitis colitis and diarrhea leading to fatal multiorgan failure
      in severe cases.
