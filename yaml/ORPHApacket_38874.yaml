  TextSection:
    Contents: Dihydropyrimidinase (DPD) deficiency is a very rare pyrimidine metabolism
      disorder with a variable clinical presentation including gastrointestinal manifestations
      (feeding problems cyclic vomiting gastroesophageal reflux malabsorption with
      villous atrophy) hypotonia intellectual deficit seizures and less frequently
      growth retardation failure to thrive microcephaly and autism. Asymptomatic cases
      are also reported. DPD deficiency increases the risk of 5-FU toxicity.
