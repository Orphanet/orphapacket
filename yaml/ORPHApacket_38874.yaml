    Contents: Dihydropyrimidinase (DPD) deficiency is a very rare pyrimidine metabolism
      disorder with a variable clinical presentation including gastrointestinal manifestations
      (feeding problems cyclic vomiting gastroesophageal reflux malabsorption with
      villous atrophy) hypotonia intellectual deficit seizures and less frequently
