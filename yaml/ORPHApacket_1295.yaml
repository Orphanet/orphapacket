  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental anomaly characterized by brachytelephalangy distinct
      craniofacial features (prominent square forehead telecanthus small nose malar
      hypoplasia smooth philtrum and thin upper lip) and relative to other family
      members short stature. These features may be associated with anosmia and hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadism (Kallman syndrome). There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1986.
