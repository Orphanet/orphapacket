  TextSection:
    Contents: Thoraco-abdominal enteric duplication is a rare syndromic intestinal
      malformation characterized by single or multiple smooth-walled often tubular
      cystic lesions which on occasion contain ectopic gastric mucosa located in the
      thorax (usually in the posterior mediastinum and to the right of the midline)
      and in the abdomen. Infants usually present with respiratory distress and older
      patients with heartburn abdominal pain vomiting and/or melena. Vertebral anomalies
      in the lower cervical spine with CNS involvement are frequently present and
      complications such as bowel obstruction perforation and intussusception have
      also been reported.
