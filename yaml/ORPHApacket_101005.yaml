  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 25 (SPG25) is a rare complex
      type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by adult-onset spastic paraplegia
      associated with spinal pain that radiates to the upper or lower limbs and is
      related to disk herniation (with minor spondylosis) as well as mild sensorimotor
      neuropathy. The SPG25 phenotype has been mapped to a locus on chromosome 6q23-q24.1.
