  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease (ADTKD)
      due to variants in or whole gene deletions of <i>HNF1B</i> which is characterized
      by chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis that manifests with nonsignificant
      urinalysis and slowly progressive renal failure. It can be associated with cystic
      kidney dysplasia early onset diabetes and extrarenal manifestations.
