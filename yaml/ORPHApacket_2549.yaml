  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare branchial arches and limb primordia development disorder characterized
      by variable degrees of uni- or bilateral craniofacial malformation and radial
      defects that result in extremely variable phenotypic manifestations. Characteristic
      features include low postnatal weight short stature vertebral defects hearing
      loss and facial dysmorphism (incl. facial asymmetry external middle and inner
      ear malformations orofacial clefts and mandibular hypoplasia). These features
      are invariably associated with radial defects such as preaxial polydactyly thumb
      and/or radius hypoplasia/agenesis or triphalangeal thumb. Cardiac pulmonary
      renal and central nervous system involvement has also been reported.
