    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency due to a defect in adaptive
      immunity characterized by the triad of congenital athymia (resulting in severe
      T-cell immunodeficiency) congenital alopecia totalis and nail dystrophy. Patients
      present neonatal or infantile-onset severe recurrent life-threatening infections
      and low or absent circulating T cells. Additional features reported include
      erythroderma lymphoadenopathy diarrhea and failure to thrive.
