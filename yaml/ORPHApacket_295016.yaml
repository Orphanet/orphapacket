    Contents: Camptodactyly of fingers is a rare genetic non-syndromic congenital
      limb malformation disorder characterized by a painless non-traumatic non-neurogenic
      often bilateral permanent flexion contracture at the proximal interphalangeal
      joint of a postaxial finger resulting in permanent volar inclination of the
      affected digit. The fifth finger is always involved but additional digits might
      also be affected.
