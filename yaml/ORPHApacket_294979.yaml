  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital absence of both forearm and hand is a rare developmental
      defect during embryogenesis characterized by unilateral or bilateral arrest
      of proximal to distal development of the upper limb leading to a transverse
      deficiency with absence of the forearm wrist and hand. A short below-the-elbow
      amputation is most commonly observed and the residual limb is usually well cushioned
      with rudimentary nubbins or dumpling possibly found on the end.
