    Contents: A rare pervasive developmental disorder characterized by microcephaly
      profound developmental delay intellectual disability bilateral cataracts severe
      epilepsy including infantile spasms hypotonia irritability feeding difficulties
      leading to failure to thrive and stereotypic hand movements. The disease manifests
      in infancy. Brain imaging reveals delay in myelination and cerebral atrophy.
