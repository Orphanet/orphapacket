  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital smooth muscle hamartoma (CSMH) is a rare cutaneous hamartomatous
      lesion most often located on the lumbosacral area or proximal limbs (but rarely
      on atypical areas such as scalp eyelid or foot) and characterized by a disorganized
      proliferation of smooth muscle fibres of arrector pili presenting usually as
      a localized skin-colored or hyperpigmented plaque (up to 10 cm in diameter)
      with prominent vellus hairs (most common classic form) or less commonly by multiple
      skin-colored papules that can coalesce to form irregularly shaped plaques. With
      time hyperpigmentation and vellus hairs usually diminish and neither malignant
      transformation nor associated systemic involvement has been reported.
