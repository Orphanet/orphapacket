  TextSection:
    Contents: Megakaryoblastic acute myeloid leukemia with t(1;22)(p13;q13) is a rare
      subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities characterized
      by clonal proliferation of myeloid blasts with predominantly megakaryoblastic
      differentiation in the bone marrow and blood often with extensive infiltration
      of the abdominal organs. It occurs typically in infants and usually presents
      with hepatosplenomegaly anemia thrombocytopenia and nonspecific symptoms related
      to ineffective hematopoiesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections).
      Myelofibrosis and fibrosis of other infiltrated organs is also characteristic
      of this disease.
