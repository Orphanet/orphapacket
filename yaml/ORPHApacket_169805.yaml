  TextSection:
    Contents: A moderately severe form of hemophilia A characterized by factor VIII
      deficiency (biological activity between 1 and 5 IU/dL) leading to abnormal bleeding
      as a result of minor injuries or following trauma surgery or tooth extraction.
      Spontaneous hemorrhages are rare. The condition primarily affects males but
      may also be observed in female carriers of disease-causing mutations.
