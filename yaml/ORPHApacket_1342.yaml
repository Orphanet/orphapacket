    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by cardiac conduction defect (sick sinus bundle-branch block) and brachydactyly
      affecting principally the middle phalanges of both hands in conjunction with
      an extra ossicle on the proximal phalanx of both index fingers. Feet abnormalities
      are more subtle. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
