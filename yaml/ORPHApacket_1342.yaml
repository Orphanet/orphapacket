  TextSection:
    Contents: Heart-hand syndrome type 3 is a very rare heart-hand syndrome (see this
      term) described in three members of a Spanish family to date which is characterized
      by a cardiac conduction defect (sick sinus bundle-branch block) and brachydactyly
      resembling brachydactyly type C of the hands (see this term) affecting principally
      the middle phalanges in conjunction with an extra ossicle on the proximal phalanx
      of both index fingers. Feet abnormalities are more subtle.
