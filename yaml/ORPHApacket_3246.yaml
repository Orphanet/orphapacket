  TextSection:
    Contents: Symphalangism with multiple anomalies of hands and feet is a rare genetic
      congenital limb malformation disorder characterized by bilateral symphalangism
      of hands and feet associated with cutaneous syndactyly of digits II-V unilateral
      or bilateral brachydactyly type D (i.e. short broad terminal phalanges of the
      thumbs) clinodactyly of fifth toes and/or mild hypoplasia of the thenar and
      hypothenar eminences. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1981.
