  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of acute myeloid leukemia that is either comprised of more than
      80% of monoblasts or 30-80% monoblasts with (pro)monocytic differentiation.
      It presents with asthenia pallor fever and dizziness. Specific features include
      hyperleukocytosis propensity for extramedullary infiltrates coagulation abnormalities
      including disseminated intravascular coagulation and neurological disorders.
      Leukemia cutis and gingival infiltration can also be seen. A characteristic
