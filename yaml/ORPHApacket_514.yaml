    Contents: Acute monoblastic leukemia (AML-M5) is one of the most common subtypes
      of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; see this term) that is either comprised of more
      than 80% of monoblasts (AML-M5a) or 30-80% monoblasts with (pro)monocytic differentiation
      (AML-M5b). AML-M5 presents with asthenia pallor fever and dizziness. Specific
      features of AML-M5 include hyperleukocytosis propensity for extramedullary infiltrates
      coagulation abnormalities including disseminated intravascular coagulation and
      neurological disorders. Leukemia cutis and gingival infiltration can also be
      seen. A characteristic translocation observed in AML-M5 is t(9;11).
