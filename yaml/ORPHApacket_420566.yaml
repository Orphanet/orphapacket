    Contents: Bleeding disorder due to CalDAG-GEFI deficiency is a rare hematologic
      disease due to defective platelet function and characterized by mucocutaneous
      bleeding starting in infancy (around 18 months of age) presenting with prolonged
      and severe epistaxis hematomas and bleeding after tooth extraction. Massive
