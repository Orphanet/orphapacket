  TextSection:
    Contents: Hepatitis delta is a rare hepatic disease characterized by variable
      degrees of acute hepatitis resulting from infection with the hepatitis delta
      virus. Occasionally it may present a benign course but most frequently it manifests
      with severe liver disease that may include fulminant liver failure hepatic decompensation
      and rapid progression to cirrhosis. All patients present concomitant hepatitis
      B virus infection and an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma
      has been reported.
