    Contents: Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is a rare hereditary vitreoretinal
      disorder characterized by abnormal or incomplete vascularization of the peripheral
      retina leading to variable clinical manifestations ranging from no effects to
      minor anomalies or even retinal detachment with blindness.
