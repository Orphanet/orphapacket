  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by acute onset of life-threatening
      thromboses in three or more organs either simultaneously or within less than
      a week in the presence of serum antiphospholipid antibodies (such as lupus anticoagulant
      anticardiolipin antibodies and anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) and with
      histopathological confirmation of small-vessel occlusion in at least one affected
      organ. The condition is often precipitated by infection trauma or surgery.
