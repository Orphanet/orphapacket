  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by an age of onset of 54-61 years and progressive Alzheimer's disease-like dementia.
      This subtype is due to a mutation in the APP gene (21q21.2) encoding the beta-amyloid
      precursor protein. This mutation causes an increased accumulation of amyloid-beta
      protein in the walls of the arteries and capillaries of the meninges cerebellar
      cortex and cerebral cortex leading to the weakening and eventual rupture of
      these vessels.
