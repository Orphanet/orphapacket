  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease a peripheral sensorimotor
      neuropathy with onset in the first to 6th decade with a gait anomaly and a leg
      weakness that reaches the arms secondarily. Tendon reflexes are reduced or absent
      and after years all patients have a pes cavus. Other signs may be present including
      hearing loss and postural tremor.
