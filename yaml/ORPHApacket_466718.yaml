  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic retinal disease characterized by characteristic "dried-out
      soil" fundus pattern due to diffuse deep white lines in the macula to the level
      of the retinal pigment epithelium which is slightly elevated and rippled. Macular
      exudation may be associated and Bruch's membrane may be affected too. Occasionally
      peripheral nummular pigmentary changes may be observed associated with blindness.
      The lesions enlarge with time with a preferential macular extension and confluence.
      Complications may include polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy choroidal neovascularization
      or atrophic fibrous macular scarring that can lead to reduced visual acuity
      over time.
