    Contents: A rare form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus characterized by
      erythematous scaly papules and plaques preferentially occurring on sun-exposed
      skin areas (scalp face and ears) and exhibiting follicular plugging pigmentary
      changes and central atrophy scarring and telangiectasia. Skin biopsy shows a
      perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate and involvement of the dermoepidermal
      junction with thickening of the basement membrane and vacuolar degeneration
      of the basal cells. A small percentage of patients may develop systemic lupus
      erythematosus.
