  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngologic disease characterized by the uni- or bilateral
      dehiscence of the bone(s) overlying the superior (most common) lateral or posterior
      semicircular canal(s). Patients present audiological (autophony aural fullness
      conductive hearing loss pulsatile tinnitus) and/or vestibular symptoms (sound
      or pressure-evoked oscillopsia or vertigo characteristic vertical-torsional
      eye movements) depending on which semicircular canal is affected. Posterior
      SCD syndrome is associated with high-riding jugular bulb and fibrous dysplasia
      while lateral SCD syndrome is associated with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma
      with or without audiological and vestibular symptoms.
