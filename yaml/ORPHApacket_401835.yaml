  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 70 is a very rare complex
      subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia that presents in infancy with delayed
      motor development (i.e. crawling walking) and is characterized by lower limb
      spasticity increased deep tendon reflexes extensor plantar responses impaired
      vibratory sensation at ankles amyotrophy and borderline intellectual disability.
      Additional signs may include gait disturbances Achilles tendon contractures
      scoliosis and cerebellar abnormalities.
