  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by adult onset of proximal muscle weakness pain and wasting predominantly affecting
      the proximal leg lumbar paraspinal and medial gastrocnemius muscles. Upper limb
      involvement may also be observed in some cases. Serum creatine kinase is often
      but not always elevated and muscle biopsy shows non-specific myopathic changes.
      The severity of the disease is variable although most patients remain ambulatory.
