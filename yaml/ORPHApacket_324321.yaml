  TextSection:
    Contents: Sinoatrial node dysfunction and deafness is a rare genetic disease characterized
      by congenital severe to profound deafness with no evidence of vestibular dysfunction
      associated with sinoatrial node dysfunction with pronounced bradycardia and
      increased variability of heart rate at rest and episodic syncopes that may be
      triggered by enhanced physical activity and stress.
