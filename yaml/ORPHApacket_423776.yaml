  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary gastric cancer refers to the occurrence of gastric cancer
      in a familial context and is described as two or more cases of gastric cancer
      in first or second degree relatives with at least one case diagnosed before
      the age of 50. Familial clustering is observed in 10% of all cases of gastric
      cancer and includes hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (early onset diffuse-type
      gastric cancer) gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach
      and familial intestinal gastric cancer (familial clustering of intestinal type
      gastric adenocarcinoma). Hereditary gastric cancer can also occur in other hereditary
      cancer syndromes such as Lynch syndrome Li-Fraumeni syndrome familial adenomatous
      polyposis and juvenile polyposis syndrome.
