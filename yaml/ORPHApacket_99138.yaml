  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemolytic anemia due to erythrocyte adenosine deaminase overproduction
      is a rare genetic hematologic disease characterized by mild chronic hemolytic
      anemia (due to highly elevated adenosine deaminase activity in red blood cells
      resulting in their premature destruction) elevated reticulocyte count splenomegaly
      and mild hyperbilirubinemia. Other cells and tissues are not affected.
