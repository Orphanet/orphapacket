  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic syndactyly characterized by complete or partial
      webbing between the 3rd and 4th fingers and/or the 2nd and 3rd toes. Other digits
      may be involved occasionally. The phenotype varies widely within and between
      families sometimes only the hands are affected and sometimes only the feet.
      Webbing between fingers may be associated with bony fusion of the distal phalanges.
