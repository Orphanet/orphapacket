  TextSection:
    Contents: Orbital leiomyoma is a rare benign smooth muscle tumor arising from
      the walls of orbital vessels characterized by its slow growth and well encapsulated
      nature. It is usually located in an extraconal position commonly manifesting
      with painless proptosis. The tumor is composed of spindle cells arranged in
      a fibrous stroma rich in dilated sinusoidal capillaries. The nuclei of tumor
      cells are oval with blunted ends and there are no mitotic figures. Orbital leiomyoma
      when excised has excellent prognosis for vision and life. One case of orbital
      leiomyosarcoma that possibly represents sarcomatous change in an orbital leiomyoma
      following radiation treatment has been reported.
