  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital isolated hyperinsulinism disorder characterized by
      diazoxide unresponsive recurrent episodes of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia resulting
      from an excessive insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells due to a mutation
      in the <i>ABCC8</i> gene. Pancreatic involvement is focal and can be cured by
      a selective partial pancreatectomy. Hypoglycemia may lead to variable clinical
      manifestations ranging from asymptomatic hypoglycemia revealed by routine blood
      glucose monitoring to macrosomia at birth mild to moderate hepatomegaly and
      life-threatening hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus further leading to
      poor neurological outcome.
