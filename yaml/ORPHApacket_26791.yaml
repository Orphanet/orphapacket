  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenation deficiency (MADD) is a disorder of
      fatty acid and amino acid oxidation and is a clinically heterogeneous disorder
      ranging from a severe neonatal presentation with metabolic acidosis cardiomyopathy
      and liver disease to a mild childhood/adult disease with episodic metabolic
      decompensation muscle weakness and respiratory failure.
