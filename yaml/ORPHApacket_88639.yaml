  TextSection:
    Contents: Neurodegeneration due to 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase deficiency
      is characterised by delayed motor development hypotonia and progressive neurodegeneration.
      To date it has been described in four boys. The syndrome is caused by mutations
      affecting the two alleles of the <i> HIBCH</i> gene encoding 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA
      hydrolase. The mode of transmission has not yet been established.
