  TextSection:
    Contents: Cataract-congenital heart disease-neural tube defect syndrome is a multiple
      congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by sacral neural tube defects resulting
      in tethered cord atrial and/or ventricular septal heart defects (that are detected
      in infancy) bilateral symmetrical hyperopia rapidly progressive early childhood
      cataracts bilateral aphakic glaucoma and abnormal facial features (low frontal
      hairline small ears short philtrum prominent widely spaced central incisors
      and micrognathia). Hypotonia growth and developmental delay seizures and joint
      limitation are also reported.
