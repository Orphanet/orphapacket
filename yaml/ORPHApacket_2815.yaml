  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by spastic paraparesis presenting
      in late childhood and hearing loss. Additional features may include retinal
      anomalies lenticular opacities short stature hypogonadism sensory deficits tremor
      dysdiochokinesia elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and absent or prolonged
      somatosensory evoked potentials. Plasma and fibroblast levels of saturated very
      long-chain fatty acids are normal. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1986.
