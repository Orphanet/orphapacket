  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive form of proximal renal tubular acidosis characterized
      by an isolated defect in the proximal tubule leading to the decreased reabsorption
      of bicarbonate and consequentially to urinary bicarbonate wastage. Presentation
      is typically with hyperchloremic acidosis usually occurring in childhood. Extrarenal
      manifestations include ocular abnormalities (band keratopathy glaucoma and cataracts)
      intellectual disability and severe growth retardation. Other features like dental
      enamel defects basal ganglia calcification and pancreatitis are sometimes present.
