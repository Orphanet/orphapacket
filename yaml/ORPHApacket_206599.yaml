  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic biological anomaly characterized by persistent elevation
      of the serum creatine phosphokinase (CK) without any clinical neurophysical
      or histopathological evidence of neuromuscular disease using the available laboratory
      procedures. It is usually an incidental finding diagnosed after exclusion of
      other possible causes of elevated CK levels.
