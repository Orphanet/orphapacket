  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 67 is an extremely rare
      complex hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by an infancy or childhood
      onset of global developmental delay and progressive spasticity with tremor in
      the distal limbs increased deep tendon reflexes and extensor plantar responses
      which may be associated with mild intellectual disability. Additional features
      include muscle wasting and cerebellar abnormalities.
