  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B) is a form of CMT1 caused
      by mutations in the <i>MPZ</i> gene (1q22) that presents with the manifestations
      of peripheral neuropathy (distal muscle weakness and atrophy foot deformities
      and sensory loss). The phenotype is variable depending on the particular mutation.
      Two distinct presentations have been described: (1) an early infantile onset
      severe phenotype with delayed walking and motor nerve conduction velocities
      (MNCV) <10 m/s often referred to as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome or (2) a much later
      onset phenotype (>age 40) with normal or mildly slowed MNCV and more frequent
      hearing loss and pupillary abnormalities. CMT1B can also cause the classical
      CMT phenotype in about 15% of total CMT1B cases.'
