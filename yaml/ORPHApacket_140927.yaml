  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neonatal-infantile onset epilepsy syndrome characterized by brief
      focal seizures between the first days and six months of life in otherwise healthy
      infants. Seizures often occur in clusters and may include motor symptoms and
      autonomic signs (including apnea and cyanosis). Occasionally generalized seizures
      are present. Typically seizures resolve spontaneously without causing any long-term
      neurological effects.
