  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign familial neonatal-infantile seizures (BFNIS) is a benign familial
      epilepsy syndrome with an intermediate phenotype between benign familial neonatal
      seizures (BFNS) and benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS). So far this syndrome
      has been described in multiple members of 10 families. Age of onset in these
      BFNIS families varied from 2 days to 6 months with spontaneous resolution in
      most cases before the age of 12 months. Like BFNS and BFIS seizures in BFNIS
      generally occur in clusters over one or a few days with posterior focal seizure
      onset. BFNIS is caused by mutations in the <i>SCN2A</i> gene (2q24.3) encoding
      the voltage-gated sodium channel alpha-subunit Na(V)1.2. Transmission is autosomal
      dominant.
