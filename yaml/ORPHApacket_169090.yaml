      channel dysfunction is a form of CID characterized by recurrent infections autoimmunity
      congenital myopathy and ectodermal dysplasia. It comprises two sub-types that
      are due to mutations in the <i>ORAI1</i> and <i>STIM1</i> genes: CID due to
      <i>ORAI1</i> deficiency and CID due to <i>STIM1</i> deficiency.'
