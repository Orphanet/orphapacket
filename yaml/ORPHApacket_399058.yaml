  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic alpha-crystallinopathy disease characterized by adult-onset
      myofibrillar myopathy variably associated with cardiomyopathy and/or posterior
      pole cataracts. Patients typically present progressive proximal and distal muscle
      weakness and wasting of lower and upper limbs often with velopharyngeal involvement
      including dysphagia dysphonia and ventilatory insufficiency. Electromyography
      shows myopathic features and muscle biopsy reveals myofibrillar myopathy changes.
