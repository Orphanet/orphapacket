  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic alpha-crystallinopathy disease characterized by adult-onset
      myofibrillar myopathy variably associated with cardiomyopathy and/or posterior
      polar cataracts. Patients typically present progressive proximal and distal
      muscle weakness and wasting of lower and upper limbs often with velopharyngeal
      involvement including dysphagia dysphonia and ventilatory insufficiency. Electromyography
      shows myopathic features and muscle biopsy reveals myofibrillar myopathy changes.
