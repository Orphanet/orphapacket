  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by increased
      susceptibility to recurrent and/or severe bacterial and viral infections (in
      particular sinopulmonary bacterial and herpesvirus infections) chronic benign
      lymphoproliferation (manifesting as lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly and focal
      nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) and/or autoimmune disease (including immune cytopenias
      juvenile arthritis glomerulonephritis and sclerosing cholangitis). Immunophenotypically
      variable degrees of agammaglobulinemia with increased IgM levels increased circulating
      transitional B cells decreased naïve CD4 and CD8 T-cells with increased CD8
      effector/memory T cells are observed.
