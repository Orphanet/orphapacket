  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by extensive epiphyseal
      tarsal spinal and sometimes metacarpal and/or phalangeal stippling severe generalized
      osteopenia vertebral clefting platyspondyly bowing and shortening of the long
      bones and variable periosteal cloaking. Laboratory analysis of lysosomal enzymes
      reveals normal activity. Histopathology shows numerous giant multinucleated
      osteoclasts lining Howship lacunae consistent with increased bone resorption.
      The condition manifests prenatally and is presumably lethal in the perinatal
      period.
