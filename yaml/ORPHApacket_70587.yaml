  TextSection:
    Contents: Infant acute respiratory distress syndrome is a lung disorder that affects
      premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of surfactant production
      and structural immaturity of the lungs. The symptoms usually appear shortly
      after birth and may include tachypnea tachycardia chest wall retractions (recession)
      expiratory grunting nasal flaring and cyanosis during breathing efforts.
