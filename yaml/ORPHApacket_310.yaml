  TextSection:
    Contents: Reflex epilepsy refers to epilepsies where recurrent seizures are provoked
      by a clearly defined extrinsic (most commonly) or intrinsic triggering stimuli
      such as flashing lights (photosensitive epilepsy) startling noises (startle
      epilepsy) urinating (micturition induced seizures) exposure to hot-water (hot
      water epilepsy) eating reading and thinking while being associated with an enduring
      abnormal predisposition to have such seizures (thereby meeting the conceptual
      definition of epilepsy).
