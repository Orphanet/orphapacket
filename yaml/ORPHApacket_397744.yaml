  TextSection:
    Contents: Peripheral neuropathy-myopathy-hoarseness-hearing loss syndrome is a
      rare syndromic genetic deafness characterized by a combination of muscle weakness
      chronic neuropathic and myopathic features hoarseness and sensorineural hearing
      loss. A wide range of disease onset and severity has been reported even within
      the same family.
