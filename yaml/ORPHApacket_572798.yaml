  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a spectrum of three main clinical phenotypes comprising a severe neonatal
      phenotype with early fatal lactic acidosis a more protracted course with early-onset
      developmental delay motor weakness extrapyramidal signs and with or without
      epilepsy and a phenotype with normal early development and Parkinson-like symptoms
      starting around the age of one year. Additional variably reported signs and
      symptoms include cardiomyopathy optic anomalies hepatosplenomegaly and abnormal
      brain MRI findings among others. Deficiencies in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
      enzymes are inconsistent.
