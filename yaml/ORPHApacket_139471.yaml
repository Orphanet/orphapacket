  TextSection:
    Contents: Microphthalmia with brain and digit anomalies is characterised by anophthalmia
      or microphthalmia retinal dystrophy and/or myopia associated in some cases with
      cerebral anomalies. It has been described in two families. Polydactyly may also
      be present. Linkage analysis allowed identification of mutations in the <I>
      BMP4</I> gene which has already been shown to play a role in eye development.
