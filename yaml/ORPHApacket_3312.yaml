  TextSection:
    Contents: Thalidomide embryopathy is a group of anomalies present in infants as
      a result of <i>in utero</i> exposure (between 20-36 days after fertilization)
      to thalidomide a sedative used in treatment of a range of conditions including
      morning sickness leprosy and multiple myeloma. Thalidomine embryopathy is characterized
      by phocomelia amelia forelimb and hand plate anomalies (absence of humerus and/or
      forearm femur and/or lower leg thumb anomalies). Other anomalies include facial
      hemangiomas and damages to ears (anotia microtia) eyes (microphthalmia anophthalmos
      coloboma strabismus) internal organs (kidney heart and gastrointestinal tract)
      genitalia and heart. Infant mortality associated with thalidomide embryopathy
      is estimated to be as high as 40%. Thalidomide is contraindicated in pregnancy
      and pregnancy prevention is recommended in women under treatment.
