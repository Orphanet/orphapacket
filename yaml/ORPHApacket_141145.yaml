    Contents: Hemifacial hyperplasia is a rare morphological anomaly of the maxillofacial
      region characterized by unilateral overgrowth of all facial structures (bone
      soft tissues teeth) called true hemifacial hypertrophy or overgrowth of one
      or more but not all facial structures called partial hemifacial hypertrophy.
      It may be isolated or related to some syndromes (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann Proteus
      Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber McCune-Albright syndrome Neurofibromatosis type 1).
      It may be associated with airway obstruction sensorineural hearing loss or swallowing
      difficulties.
