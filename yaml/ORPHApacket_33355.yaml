    Contents: Reticular dysgenesis is the most severe form of severe combined immunodeficiency
      (SCID; see this term) and is characterized by bilateral sensorineural deafness
      and a lack of innate and adaptive immune functions leading to fatal septicemia
      within days after birth if not treated.
