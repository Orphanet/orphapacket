  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare complex congenital spinal anomaly characterized by localized
      agenesis/dysgenesis of the spine (usually lumbar or thoracolumbar spine) kypho-scoliotic
      deformity (including severe congenital kyphosis or kyphoscoliosis) and focal
      abnormalities of the underlying spinal cord and nerve roots. Typically there
      is segmental absence or malformation of the spinal cord characterized by normal
      upper spinal cord and significantly abnormal (thinned or even barely perceptible)
      affected cord segment without nerve roots and a thickened bulky distal cord.
      Closed spinal dysraphism may be present. Majority of the affected individuals
      present with neurogenic bladder (sometimes with vesicoureteral reflux) severe
      motor impairment (spastic paraparesis/paraplegia) reduced or absent tendon reflexes
      and severely hypotrophied and deformed lower limbs. In some patients clonus
      hypotonia clubfoot horseshoe kidney and bilateral hip dislocation were reported.
