    Contents: "A rare localized variant of Guillain-Barr\xE9 syndrome characterized\
      \ by rapidly progressive bilateral facial nerve palsy distal paresthesias and\
      \ minimal or no motor weakness. Deep tendon reflexes are usually diminished\
      \ or absent but can be present or even exaggerated in rare cases. CSF analysis\
      \ may reveal albuminocytologic dissociation. Nerve conduction velocity studies\
      \ often show demyelinating type of neuropathy although axonal polyneuropathy\
      \ has been also described."
