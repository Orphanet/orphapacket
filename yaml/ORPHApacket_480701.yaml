    Contents: A rare localized variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome characterized by
      rapidly progressive bilateral facial nerve palsy distal paresthesias and minimal
      or no motor weakness. Deep tendon reflexes are usually diminished or absent
      but can be present or even exaggerated in rare cases. CSF analysis may reveal
      albuminocytologic dissociation. Nerve conduction velocity studies often show
      demyelinating type of neuropathy although axonal polyneuropathy has been also
      described.
