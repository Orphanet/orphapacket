    Contents: Focal palmoplantar and gingival keratoderma is a very rare form of focal
      palmoplantar keratoderma characterized by painful circumscribed hyperkeratotic
      lesions on weight-bearing areas of soles moderate focal hyperkeratosis of palmar
      pressure-related areas and an asymptomatic leukokeratosis confined to labial-
      and lingual- attached gingiva. Additional occasional features may include hyperhidrosis
      follicular keratosis and extended oral mucosa involvement.
