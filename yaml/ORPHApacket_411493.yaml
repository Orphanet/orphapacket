  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic pontocerebellar hypoplasia subtype characterized by severe
      psychomotor developmental delay progressive microcephaly progressive spasticity
      seizures and brain abnormalities consisting of mild atrophy of the cerebellum
      pons and corpus callosum and cortical atrophy with delayed myelination. Patients
      may present dysmorphic facial features (high arched eyebrows prominent eyes
      long palpebral fissures and eyelashes broad nasal root and hypoplastic alae
      nasi) and an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy.
