  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1F (CMT1F) is a form of CMT1 with a
      variable clinical presentation that can range from severe impairment with onset
      in childhood to mild impairment appearing during adulthood. CMT1F is characterized
      by a progressive peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy with distal paresis
      in the lower limbs that varies from mild weakness to complete paralysis of the
      distal muscle groups absent tendon reflexes and reduced nerve conduction. CMT1F
      represents the ''demyelinating'' form of CMT2E and is caused by mutations in
      the <i>NEFL</i> gene (8p21.2).
