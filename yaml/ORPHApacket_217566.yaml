  TextSection:
    Contents: Chronic respiratory distress with surfactant metabolism deficiency is
      a rare genetic primary interstitial lung disease with a highly variable clinical
      presentation ranging from neonatal respiratory distress syndrome to mild to
      severe interstitial lung disease (typical symptoms include cough tachypnea hypoxia
      clubbing crackles failure to thrive). Lung biopsy reveals diffuse alveolar damage
      interstitial thickening with inflammatory infiltrates fibroblast proliferation
      collagen deposition and multiple foci of fibrosis alveolar type II cell hyperplasia
      abundant foamy alveolar macrophages and granular lipoproteic material in the
      alveolar lumen. Imaging shows cystic spaces and ground-glass opacities that
      are typically homogenously diffuse.
