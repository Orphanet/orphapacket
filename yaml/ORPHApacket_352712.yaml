    Contents: "Facial dysmorphism-immunodeficiency-livedo-short stature syndrome is\
      \ a rare genetic disease characterized by facial dysmorphism with malar hypoplasia\
      \ and high forehead immunodeficiency resulting in recurrent infections impaired\
      \ growth (with normal growth hormone production and response) resulting in short\
      \ stature and livedo affecting face and extremities. Immunological analyses\
      \ show low memory B-cell and na\xEFve T cell counts decreased T cell proliferation\
      \ and reduced IgM IgG2 and IgG4 titers. Patients do not exhibit increased susceptibility\
      \ to cancer."
