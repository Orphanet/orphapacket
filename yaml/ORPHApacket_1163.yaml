  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare infectious disease caused by inhalation of the opportunistic
      fungus <i>aspergillus</i> that can lead to the following manifestations: allergic
      bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) aspergilloma chronic necrotizing pulmonary
      aspergillosis (CNPA) and invasive aspergillosis (IA). Aspergilloma occurs in
      patients with cavitary lung disease and results in a fungal mass with variable
      clinical presentations from asymptomatic to life-threatening (massive hemoptysis).
      CNPA manifests as subacute pneumonia in patients with underlying disease. IA
      is disseminated aspergillosis that eventually invades other organs. Cutaneous
      aspergillosis is usually the dermatological manifestation of IA that manifests
      as erythematous-to-violaceous plaques or papules often characterized by a central
      necrotic ulcer or eschar.'
