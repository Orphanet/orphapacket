    Contents: Nevus of Ota is an oculodermal melanocytosis more commonly found in
      Asian and African populations usually present at birth and characterized by
      a usually unilateral bluish gray patchy speckled pigmentation (that may progressively
      enlarge and darken) affecting the skin of the face along the distribution of
      the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve (periorbital
      region temple forehead malar area nose). In 2/3 cases the ipsilateral sclera
      is affected. Nevus of Ota usually remains stable once adulthood is reached but
      an increased risk of glaucoma and uveal melanoma may be observed. Extracutaneous
      lesions may also occur in cornea retina tympanum nasal mucosa pharynx palate.
      Nevus of Ota occurs as solitary conditions but seldom may occur together with
      the nevus of Ito or nevus spilus.
