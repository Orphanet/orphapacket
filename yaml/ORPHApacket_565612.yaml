  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by massive accumulation
      of triglycerides in the myocardium and coronary arteries while plasma triglyceride
      levels are normal. Patients present in adulthood with signs and symptoms of
      coronary artery disease and severe heart failure. Concomitant skeletal myopathy
      is common. Vacuole formation in polymorphonuclear leukocytes is typically observed.
