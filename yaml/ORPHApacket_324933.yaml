  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of systemic diseases characterized by mixed patterns of dysregulated
      innate and/or adaptive immune responses leading to chronic activation of the
      immune system and tissue inflammation which presents clincally with a wide range
      of variable concomitant autoimmune and autoinflammatory manifestations in various
      organ systems.
