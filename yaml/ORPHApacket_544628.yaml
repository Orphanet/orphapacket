  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by the association of Fanconi syndrome
      and nephrocalcinosis in addition to neonatal hyperinsulinism and macrosomia.
      Patients display a phenotype of proximal tubulopathy characterized by generalized
      aminoaciduria low molecular weight proteinuria glycosuria hyperphosphaturia
      and hypouricemia and additional features not normally seen in Fanconi syndrome
      (apart from nephrocalcinosis) namely renal impairment hypercalciuria with relative
      hypocalcemia and hypermagnesemia.
