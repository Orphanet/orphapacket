  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic lipodystrophy characterized by loss of subcutaneous adipose
      tissue primarily affecting the lower limbs and gluteal region due to a defect
      in the PLIN1 gene. Associated features of insulin resistance hepatic steatosis
      dyslipidemia hypertension axillary acanthosis nigricans and muscular hypertrophy
      of the lower limbs are typical.
