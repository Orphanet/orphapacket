  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic disorder with strabismus characterized by congenital
      non-progressive ophthalmoplegia affecting the oculomotor and/or trochlear nucleus/nerve
      and their innervated muscles. Patients present with abnormal resting position
      of the eyes (in most cases infraducted and exotropic) limitation of vertical
      and horizontal gaze impaired binocular vision amblyopia unilateral or bilateral
      blepharoptosis and compensatory abnormal head posture. Extraocular manifestations
      include intellectual disability peripheral neuropathy and skeletal abnormalities
      among others.
