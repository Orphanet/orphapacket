  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by facial dysmorphism (microcephaly high forehead low posterior hairline strabismus)
      hypotonia failure to thrive intractable seizures developmental delay persistent
      vomiting and gastric bleeding. Additional features that may be observed include
      fat pads anomalies inverted nipples and body temperature oscillation. The disease
      is caused by mutations in the gene <i>ALG11</i> (13q14.3).
