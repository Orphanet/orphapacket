  TextSection:
    Contents: Heritable pulmonary arterial hypertension (HPAH) is a form of pulmonary
      arterial hypertension (PAH see this term) occurring due to mutations in PAH
      predisposing genes or in a familial context. HPAH is characterized by elevated
      pulmonary arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. HPAH is progressive
      and potentially fatal.
