  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare peroxisomal beta-oxidation disorder characterized by deficiency
      of peroxisomal D-bifunctional protein type 1 being caused by deficiency of both
      dehydrogenase and hydratase activities of the enzyme and types 2 and 3 by hydratase
      or dehydrogenase deficiency alone while type 4 is due to compound heterozygous
      mutations affecting both units and represents a clinically milder phenotype.
      Types 1-3 are typically fatal in infancy. Patients present with early onset
      of generalized hypotonia seizures severe global developmental delay craniofacial
      dysmorphism (large fontanel high forehead hypertelorism epicanthal folds) and
      elevated plasma very long chain fatty acids. Variable features include hepatomegaly
      polymicrogyria and cerebral white matter abnormalities among others.
