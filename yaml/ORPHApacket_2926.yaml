  TextSection:
    Contents: Digital extensor muscle aplasia-polyneuropathy is a rare hereditary
      motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by flexion deformities of the thumb
      and fingers sensory deficit in the hand and polyneuropathic electrophysiologic
      findings in the limbs. Operation on the hands reveals extensor muscles and their
      tendons to be absent or hypoplastic. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1986.
