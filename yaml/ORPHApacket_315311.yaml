      deficiency characterized by abnormal genital development with variable levels
      of virilization in females and normal genitalia in males in association with
      glucocorticoid insufficiency with absence of salt-wasting accelerated growth
      velocity and bone maturation premature adrenarche and precocious puberty leading
