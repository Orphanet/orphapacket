    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with miniepiphyses is a rare primary bone
      dysplasia disorder characterized by strikingly small secondary ossification
      centers (mini-epiphyses) in all or only some joints resulting in severe bone
      dysplasia of the proximal femoral heads. Short stature increased lumbar lordosis
      genua vara and generalized joint laxity have also been reported.
