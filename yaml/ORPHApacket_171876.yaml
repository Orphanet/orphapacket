  TextSection:
    Contents: A severe form of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 characterized by salt
      wasting in multiple organs including the kidney colon and sweat and salivary
      glands. Presentation is in the first few weeks of life with severe dehydration
      vomiting and failure to thrive in association with hyponatremia hyperkalemia
      and metabolic acidosis as well as elevated aldosterone and renin levels. No
      remission is reported and patients suffer from recurrent life-threatening episodes
      of salt loss.
