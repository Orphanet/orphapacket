    Contents: A rare odontogenic tumor characterized by aggressive clinical course
      and local destruction occurring in mandible more often than in maxilla. The
      most common symptom is a rapidly progressing painful swelling but it may present
      as a benign cystic lesion or as a large rapidly growing mass with ulceration
      bone resorption and teeth mobility as well. The tumor may metastasize most commonly
      to the cervical lymph nodes and the lungs.
