    Contents: A rare syndrome with intellectual disability characterized by failure
      to thrive short stature joint laxity soft skin and distinctive facial features.
      Cardiac and neurological involvement is common and there is an increased lifetime
      risk of certain tumors. Costello syndrome belongs to the RASopathies a group
      of conditions resulting from germline derived point mutations affecting the
      RAS-mitogen activated protein kinase pathway.
