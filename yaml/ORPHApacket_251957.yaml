  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by a mostly supratentorial
      space-occupying lesion often involving the temporal lobe although it may occur
      anywhere in the central nervous system. The tumor shows anaplastic features
      in its glial component and is considered WHO grade III which may albeit inconsistently
      indicate more aggressive behavior and less favorable prognosis. Clinical symptoms
      vary according to the location the most common manifestation being seizures.
