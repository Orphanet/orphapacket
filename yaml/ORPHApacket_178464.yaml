  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by adult onset of
      slowly progressive distal and/or proximal muscle weakness in the upper and lower
      extremities and early involvement of respiratory muscles leading to respiratory
      failure. Additional features are neck flexor weakness foot extensor weakness
      and in rare cases mildly impaired cardiac function. Muscle biopsy shows eosinophilic
      myofibrillar inclusions referred to as cytoplasmic bodies as well as fiber size
      variation increased internal nuclei and connective tissue fiber splitting and
      rimmed vacuoles.
