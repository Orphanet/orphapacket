      delay intellectual disability ataxia and more variably seizures and short stature.
      Behavioral abnormalities may also be observed as well as variable facial and
      other dysmorphic features (such as broad nasal bridge hypertelorism almond-shaped
      eyes high-arched palate and anomalies of the fingers and toes). Brain imaging
