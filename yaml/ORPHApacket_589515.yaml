    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by developmental
      delay intellectual disability ataxia and more variably seizures and short stature.
      Behavioral abnormalities may also be observed as well as variable facial and
      other dysmorphic features (such as broad nasal bridge hypertelorism almond-shaped
      eyes high-arched palate and anomalies of the fingers and toes). Brain imaging
      may reveal dilated ventricles small corpus callosum or posterior fossa abnormalities.
