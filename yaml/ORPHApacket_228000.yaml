    Contents: "Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is a rare primary immunodeficiency disorder\
      \ characterized by persistent CD4 T-cell lymphopenia (less than 300 cells/\xB5\
      L on multiple occasions) not associated with any other underlying primary or\
      \ secondary immune deficiency. Patients typically present opportunistic infections\
      \ (with cryptococcal mycobacterial candidal varicella zoster virus infections\
      \ and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy being the most prevalent) malignancies\
      \ (mainly lymphoproliferative disorders) or autoimmune disorders. Some individuals\
      \ are asymptomatic and incidentally diagnosed."
