      cells arranged in multilayered rosettes and displaying one of three morphological
      patterns: embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes ependymoblastoma
      or medulloepithelioma. The tumors typically have a C19MC alteration or (rarely)
      a <i>DICER1</i> mutation and correspond to WHO grade IV. They are mostly localized
      intracranially rarely in the spinal cord and commonly cause signs and symptoms
      of elevated intracranial pressure sometimes seizures and focal neurological
