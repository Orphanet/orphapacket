  TextSection:
    Contents: Osteofibrous dysplasia is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia characterized
      by the presence of a benign fibro-osseous osteolytic tumor typically located
      in the tibia (occasionally the fibula or both) and usually involving the anterior
      diaphyseal cortex with adjacent cortical expansion. It may on occasion be asymptomatic
      or may present with a palpable mass pain tenderness and/or anterior bowing of
      the tibia.
