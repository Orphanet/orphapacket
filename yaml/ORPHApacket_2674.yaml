  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by a specific facial appearance (consisting of a thickened ridged triangular
      skin fold extending from the glabella to the anterior fontanel bilateral elevation
      of the medial portion of the eyebrows hypertelorism low-set ears posteriorly
      rotated ears and widow's peak) variable skeletal deformities and neuromuscular
      and sensory defects which can be incapacitating in some individuals. Reported
      features include limb muscle wasting congenital kyphoscoliosis hip dislocation
      congenital talipes equinovarus arthrogryposis joint stiffness/ankyloses ptosis
      and cataracts. Intelligence is normal. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1992.
