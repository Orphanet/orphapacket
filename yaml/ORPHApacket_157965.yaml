  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) due to variants
      in the <i>SLC39A13</i> gene and characterized by the presence of thin and finely
      wrinkled skin of the hands and feet hypermobile distal joints characteristic
      facial features (downslanting palpebral fissures mild hypertelorism prominent
      eyes with a paucity of periorbital fat blueish sclerae microdontia or oligodontia)
      muscular hypotonia associated with significant short stature of childhood-onset
      ocular findings (myopia and keratoconus) and more rarely vascular complications.
      Mild radiographic changes were observed among which platyspondyly is a useful
      diagnostic feature.
