  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-syndromic developmental defect during embryogenesis
      malformation syndrome characterized by a congenital non-progressive occipitofrontal
      head circumference that is 2 or more standard deviations below the mean for
      age gender and ethnicity which is associated with normal brain architecture
      and uncomplicated by other abnormalities. Borderline to moderate intellectual
      disability as well as early psychomotor delay may or may not be associated.
