  TextSection:
    Contents: Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a rare congenital
      autosomal recessive disease presenting in children and adolescents and characterized
      by progressive scoliosis along with the absence of conjugate horizontal eye
      movements and associated with failure of the somatosensory and corticospinal
      neuronal tracts to decussate in the medulla.
