  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by proximal muscle
      weakness presenting in early childhood (with occasional falls and difficulties
      in climbing stairs) and a progressive course resulting in loss of ambulation
      in early adulthood. Muscle atrophy and multiple contractures have also been
      reported in rare cases.
