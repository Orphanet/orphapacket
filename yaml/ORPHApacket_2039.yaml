  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital systemic arteriovenous fistula is a rare potentially life-threatening
      vascular malformation characterized by a direct communication between an artery
      and a vein without the interposition of the capillary bed ocurring in the systemic
      circulation (mainly the cranium liver lungs extremities and vessels in or near
      the thoracic wall). Manifestations are variable depending on size and extent
      of the fistula the involved blood vessels and the precise location of the collaterals
      and may include systolic or continuous murmur over the affected organ tachycardia
      increased stroke volume cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings.
