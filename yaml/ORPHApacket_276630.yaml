    Contents: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability which in symptomatic
      female carriers is characterized by a highly variable phenotype including facial
      dysmorphisms (prominent forehead hypertelorism down-slanting palpebral fissures
      epicanthic folds thick lips with everted lower vermilion thick nasal alae and
      septum) short hands with tapering fingers short stature and skeletal findings
      (progressive kyphoscoliosis). Intellectual disability is mild to moderate but
      intellect can also be normal. A high rate of psychiatric disorders has also
      been reported.
