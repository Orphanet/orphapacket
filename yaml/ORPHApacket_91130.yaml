  TextSection:
    Contents: Cardiomyopathy-hypotonia-lactic acidosis syndrome is characterised by
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy muscular hypotonia and the presence of lactic acidosis
      at birth. It has been described in two sisters (both of whom died within the
      first year of life) from a nonconsanguineous Turkish family. The syndrome is
      caused by a homozygous point mutation in the exon 3A of the <i>SLC25A3</i> gene
      encoding a mitochondrial membrane transporter.
