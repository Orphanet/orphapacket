  TextSection:
    Contents: Juvenile xanthogranuloma is the most common type of non-Langerhans cell
      histiocytosis characterized by the occurrence of one or more reddish or yellowish
      self-limiting and benign papules or nodules of several millimeters in diameter
      usually appearing on the head and neck (but sometimes on the extremities and
      trunk) during the first year of life (or rarely in adulthood) and usually regressing
      spontaneously. Extracutaneous involvement has also been reported involving most
      commonly the eye (uveal tract) but with other locations including the central
      nervous system lung liver bones and endocrine glands and may be associated with
      considerable morbidity.
