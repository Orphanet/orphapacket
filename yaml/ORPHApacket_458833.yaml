      in the head and neck (but may affect any site) and which have varying clinical
      presentation depending on specific size and location of lesion. Categorization
      into macrocystic lympathic malformations microcystic lymphatic malformations
      or mixed cystic lymphatic malformations is reported based on the size of the
      cyst(s) contained within the lesion. Functional deficits and compromise of vital
