  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by intermediate
      motor median nerve conduction velocities (usually between 25 and 60 m/s). It
      presents with moderately severe slowly progressive usual clinical features of
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (muscle weakness and atrophy of the distal extremities
      distal sensory loss reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes feet deformities
      extensor digitorum brevis atrophy). Findings in nerve biopsies include age-dependent
      axonal degeneration reduced number of large myelinated fibres segmental remyelination
      and no onion bulbs.
