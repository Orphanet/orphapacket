  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant germ cell tumor characterized by predominant composition
      of embryoid bodies consisting of a central core of embryonal carcinoma cells
      an amnion-like cavity and a yolk sac tumor component. The tumor usually occurs
      as the dominant component of a mixed germ cell tumor with teratoma being the
      most common associated element. It may manifest as an abdominal mass or with
      abdominal pain menstrual irregularities or precocious puberty in women while
      men typically present with testicular enlargement. Serum alpha-fetoprotein and/or
      beta-human chorionic gonadotropin can be elevated.
