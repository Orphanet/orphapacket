  TextSection:
    Contents: Woolly hair nevus (WHN) is a rare non-familial hair anomaly characterized
      by kinky tightly coiled and hypopigmented fine hair with an average diameter
      of 0.5 cm noted since birth or during the first two years of life in a localized
      circumscribed distribution on the scalp. Occassionally WHN grows in areas observed
      to be alopecic in the neonatal period. WHN can be associated with features like
      ocular defects (persistent pupillary membrane retinal defects) precocious puberty
      and epidermal nevi.
