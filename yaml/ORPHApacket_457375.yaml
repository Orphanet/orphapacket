    Contents: A rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by early onset encephalopathy
      with progressive microcephaly severe global development delay seizures hypotonia
      feeding difficulties variable cardiac abnormalities and cataracts. Brain MRI
      shows distinct pattern with high T2 signal and restricted diffusion in the posterior
