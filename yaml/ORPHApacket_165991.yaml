  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of congenital diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism
      characterized by episodes of hypoglycemia induced by exercise due to an inappropriate
      lactate and pyruvate sensitivity in pancreatic beta-cells. Presentation is of
      recurring episodes of hypoglycemia associated with elevated insulin levels within
      30 minutes of a short period of anaerobic exercise. The degree of hypoglycemia
      associated with exercise is variable and is only partially responsive to diazoxide.
