  TextSection:
    Contents: Diazoxide-resistant diffuse hyperinsulism (DRDH) is a form of Diazoxide
      resistant hyperinsulinism (see this term) characterized by recurrent episodes
      of profound hypoglycemia caused by an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion
      (inappropriate for the level of glycemia) due to diffuse involvement of pancreas
      that is unresponsive to medical treatment with diazoxide often necessitating
      near total/total pancreatectomy.
