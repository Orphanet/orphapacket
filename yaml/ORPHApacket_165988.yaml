  TextSection:
    Contents: Diazoxide-resistant diffuse hyperinsulism (DRDH) is a form of Diazoxide
      resistant hyperinsulinism characterized by recurrent episodes of profound hypoglycemia
      caused by an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate for the
      level of glycemia) due to diffuse involvement of pancreas that is unresponsive
      to medical treatment with diazoxide often necessitating near total/total pancreatectomy.
