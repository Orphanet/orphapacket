  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe intellectual disability and progressive spastic paraplegia is
      a rare complex spastic paraplegia characterized by an early onset hypotonia
      that progresses to spasticity global developmental delay severe intellectual
      disability and speech impairment microcephaly short stature and dysmorphic features.
      Patients often become non-ambulatory and some develop seizures and stereotypic
