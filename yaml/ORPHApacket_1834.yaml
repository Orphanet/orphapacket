  TextSection:
    Contents: Axial mesodermal dysplasia spectrum is a rare developmental defect during
      embryogenesis syndrome characterized by congenital manifestations of both oculo-auriculo-vertebral
      spectrum and caudal regression sequence. Phenotype is highly variable but patients
      typically present facial dysmorphism (incl. asymmetry hypertelorism) auricular
      abnormalities (e.g. preauricular tags microtia absence of middle ear ossicles)
      skeletal malformations (hemivertebrae hip dislocation sacral agenesis/dysplasia
      talipes equinovarus flexion deformity of lower limbs) cardiac defects (dextrocardia
      septal defects) renal and genitourinary anomalies (such as renal agensis/dysplasia
      abnormal external genitalia cryptorchidia) as well as anal anomalies such as
      anal atresia and rectovesical fistula.
