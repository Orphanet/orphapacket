  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive syndrome with combined immunodeficiency characterized
      by the clinical triad of immunodeficiency centromeric instability and facial
      anomalies (abbreviated ICF syndrome). The immunodeficiency is with panhypogammaglobulinemia
      and a lack of memory (CD19+CD27+) B cells in the peripheral blood although B
      and T-cell counts are normal. Anomalies and rearrangements associated with DNA
      hypomethylation in the vicinity of the centromeres (the juxtacentromeric heterochromatin)
      of chromosomes 1 and 16 and sometimes 9 in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes is
      a hallmark of the syndrome. The typical facial anomalies include hypertelorism
      low-set ears epicanthus and macroglossia.
