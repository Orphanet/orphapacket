  TextSection:
    Contents: The Immunodeficiency Centromeric region instability Facial anomalies
      syndrome (ICF) is a rare autosomal recessive disease characterized by immunodeficiency
      although B cells are present and by characteristic rearrangements in the vicinity
      of the centromeres (the juxtacentromeric heterochromatin) of chromosomes 1 and
      16 and sometimes 9.
