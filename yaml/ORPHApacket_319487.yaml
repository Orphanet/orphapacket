  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma is a rare hereditary
      nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma characterized by the presence of differentiated
      thyroid cancer of follicular cell origin in two or more first-degree relatives
      in the absence of other familial tumor syndromes or radiation exposure. Frequent
      capsular invasion is observed. Biopsy reveals multicentric tumors with multiple
      adenomatous nodules with or without oxyphilia and follicular or papillary carcinoma
      histology.
