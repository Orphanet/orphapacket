  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by non-infectious eosinophilic infiltration
      of the hair follicles. Patients present with chronically recurrent crops of
      itchy follicular papulopustules with peripheral extension and central clearing.
      Small papules tend to enlarge and coalesce into large plaques. The lesions favor
      the face and trunk although the extremities can also be involved. Laboratory
      analysis may show peripheral leukocytosis and eosinophilia while clinically
      systemic involvement is not evident.
