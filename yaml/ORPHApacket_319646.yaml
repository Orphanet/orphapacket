  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic congenital disorder of glycosylation and glycogen storage
      disease characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations most commonly
      presenting with bifid uvula with or without cleft palate at birth associated
      with growth delay hepatopathy with elevated aminotransferase serum levels myopathy
      (including exercise-related fatigue exercise intolerance muscle weakness) intermittent
      hypoglycemia and dilated cardiomyopathy and/or cardiac arrest due to decreased
      phosphoglucomutase 1 enzyme activity. Less common manifestations include malignant
      hyperthermia rhabdomyolysis and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with delayed puberty.
