    Contents: Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome describes a spectrum
      of Mullerian duct anomalies characterized by congenital aplasia of the uterus
      and upper 2/3 of the vagina in otherwise phenotypically normal females. It can
      be classified as either MRKH syndrome type 1 (corresponding to isolated utero-vaginal
      aplasia) or MRKH syndrome type 2 (utero-vaginal aplasia associated with other
      malformations) (see these terms).
