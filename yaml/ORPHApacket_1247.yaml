  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease characterized by infection with trematodes
      of the genus <i>Schistosoma</i>. Humans become infected when larvae (cercariae)
      in infested freshwater penetrate the skin potentially causing cercarial dermatitis.
      After a few weeks eggs laid by the adult female worms living in blood vessels
      become trapped in body tissues causing progressive organ damage due to inflammation
      granuloma formation and fibrosis. Acute schistosomiasis presents with fever
      cough headache and urticaria while chronic manifestations depend on the localization
      of the eggs and typically include abdominal pain diarrhea hepatosplenomegaly
      blood in stool or urine and dysuria among others.
