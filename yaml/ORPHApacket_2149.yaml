  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic cerebral malformation due to abnormal neuronal
      migration characterized by clusters of disorganized neurons in abnormal locations
      such as periventricular and subcortical. The extent of the lesions ranges from
      isolated single to bilateral confluent nodules. Pediatric patients typically
      show variable degrees of developmental delay intellectual disability and intractable
      epilepsy and concomitant cerebral and/or systemic malformations are frequent.
      Milder forms may present with onset of seizures in adulthood.
