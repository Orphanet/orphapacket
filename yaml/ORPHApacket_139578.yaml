  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by infantile to childhood
      onset of progressive sensory neuropathy in association with spastic paraplegia
      and mutilating acropathy. Patients present lower limb spasticity and progressive
      severe sensory loss leading to chronic ulcerations in both upper and lower limbs.
      Electrophysiological studies are consistent with axonal sensory neuropathy and
      nerve biopsy shows axonopathy with loss of myelinated nerve fibers of all diameters
      as well as of unmyelinated axons.
