  TextSection:
    Contents: Paramedian nasal cleft is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by a unilateral or bilateral coloboma of the nose ranging in severity
      from a small notch resulting in minor deviation of the nasal septum to variable-sized
      clefts of the nasal ala which may be associated with small cysts or sinuses
      in the nasal midline. Defect may be isolated or may occur in association with
      cleft lip and/or other craniofacial anomalies (e.g. hypertelorism broadening
      of nasal root midline cleft). Dorsum and apex of nose are usually well preserved.
