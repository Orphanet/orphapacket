  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic immune deficiency with skin involvement characterized
      by clinical triad of non-scarring alopecia affecting mainly the scalp well-demarcated
      mucosal erythema and psoriasiform erythematous intertriginous plaques. Follicular
      keratosis keratoconjuctivitis cataracts angular cheilitis fissured tongue and
      recurrent infections are additional clinical features. Histopathology of mucosal
      lesions show characteristic findings of dyskeratotic keratinocytes vacuolated
      basal cells lack of epithelial maturation and decreased number of desmosomes.
