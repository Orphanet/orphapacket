  TextSection:
    Contents: Extensor tendons of finger anomalies is a rare genetic congenital limb
      malformation characterized by bilateral anomalous attachment of the extensor
      tendons of the four ulnar fingers. Attachment occurrs to the medial and lateral
      aspects of the middle phalanges leading to constant flexion in the midphalangeal
      joints and inability to extend the fingers. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1980.
