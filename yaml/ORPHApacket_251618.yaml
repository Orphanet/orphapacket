  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare astrocytoma characterized by a benign slowly growing lesion that
      typically arises in the walls of the lateral ventricles and most commonly occurs
      in patients <&nbsp;20 years with tuberous sclerosis complex. Most patients present
      with worsening epilepsy or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. This
      WHO grade 1 tumor is composed of astrocytes with various phenotypes (i.e. polygonal
      gemistocytic spindle and ganglionic-like). On immunohistochemistry it is usually
      positive for GFAP S100 beta-tubulin neurofilament synaptophysin NeuN TTF1 and
      phosphorylated S6 but shows weak or negative staining for tuberin hamartin and
      Ki-67. It has its specific DNA methylation profile.
