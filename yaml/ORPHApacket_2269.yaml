    Contents: "Ichthyosis-alopecia-eclabion-ectropion-intellectual disability syndrome\
      \ is an ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by severe generalized lamellar\
      \ icthyosis at birth with alopecia eclabium ectropion and intellectual disability.\
      \ Although similar to Sj\xF6gren-Larsson syndrome this syndrome lacks the presence\
      \ of neurologic or macular changes. There have been no further descriptions\
      \ in the literature since 1987."
