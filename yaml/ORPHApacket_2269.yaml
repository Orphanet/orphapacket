    Contents: Ichthyosis-alopecia-eclabion-ectropion-intellectual disability syndrome
      is an ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by severe generalized lamellar
      icthyosis at birth with alopecia eclabium ectropion and intellectual disability.
      Although similar to Sjögren-Larsson syndrome this syndrome lacks the presence
      of neurologic or macular changes. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1987.
