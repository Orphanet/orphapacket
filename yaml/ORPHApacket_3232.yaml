  TextSection:
    Contents: Deafness-ear malformation-facial palsy syndrome is characterized by
      profound conductive deafness due to stapedial abnormalities associated with
      variable malformations of the external ears and facial paralysis. It has been
      described in three sibs and their mother. Inheritance is autosomal dominant.
