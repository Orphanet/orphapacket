  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare intestinal disease characterized by chronic or relapsing subileus
      or ileus resulting from multiple unexplained fibrous structures and multiple
      shallow (i. e. limited to the mucosa or submucosa) ulcerations of the small
      intestine (mainly the ileum) in the absence of signs of a systemic inflammatory
      reaction. Patients may present with chronic iron-deficiency anemia due to chronic
      intestinal blood loss chronic recurrent abdominal pain fatigue edema or growth
      retardation. Extraintestinal manifestations such as Sicca syndrome polyarthralgia
      or Raynaud's phenomenon may also be observed.
