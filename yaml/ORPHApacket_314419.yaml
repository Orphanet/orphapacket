    Contents: A rare benign slow-growing odontologic tumor located in the mandible
      and on occasion the maxilla characterized by painless variable-sized jaw swelling
      which if left untreated may lead to a grotesque facial appearance. Occasionally
      paresthesias tooth displacement and adjacent root resorption may be associated.
      Local invasion is frequently observed but malignant transformation and metastasis
      are not common.
