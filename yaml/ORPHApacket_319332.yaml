  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive myogenic arthrogryposis multiplex congenita is a
      rare inherited neuromuscular disease characterized by prenatal presentation
      (usually in the second trimester) of reduced fetal movements and abnormal positioning
      resulting in joint abnormalities that may involve both lower and upper extremities
      and is usually symmetric severe hypotonia at birth with bilateral club foot
      motor development delay mild facial weakness without opthalmoplegia absent deep
      tendon reflexes normal motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities no cerebellar
      or pyramidal involvement and progressive disease course with loss of ambulation
      after the first decade of life.
