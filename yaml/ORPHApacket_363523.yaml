    Contents: Hypohidrosis-enamel hypoplasia-palmoplantar keratoderma-intellectual
      disability syndrome is a rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder
      characterized by severe intellectual disability with significant speech and
      language impairment hypohydrosis (often resulting in hyperthermia) with normal
      sweat gland appearance tooth enamel hypoplasia palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and
      a high frequency of acquired microcephaly. Mild facial dysmorphism including
