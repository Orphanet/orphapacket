  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by short middle phalanges
      of the 2nd and 5th fingers and absence of the middle phalanges of toes 2 to
      5. Occasionally the 4th digit may be affected and manifests with an abnormally
      shaped middle phalanx which causes radial deviation of the distal phalanx. Other
      hand/foot malformations such as syndactyly polydactyly reduction defects and
      symphalangism may be associated.
