  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) induced by genetic mutations
      disrupting surfactant function and gas exchange in the lung. The disorders caused
      by these mutations affect full-term infants and older children and exhibit considerable
      overlap in their clinical and histologic presentation.
