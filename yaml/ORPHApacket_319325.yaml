    Contents: Tubulocystic renal cell carcinoma is an extremely rare subtype of renal
      cell carcinoma most frequently characterized by a small solitary well-circumscribed
      unencapsulated renal tumor composed of multiple small to medium-sized cysts
      with a white or gray spongy ("bubble wrap-like") cut surface. Patients are usually
      asymptomatic or could manifest with abdominal pain abdominal distension and/or
