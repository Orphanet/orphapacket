    Contents: A rare disorder of plasmalogen biosynthesis characterized by syndromic
      severe intellectual disability with congenital cataracts early-onset epilepsy
      microcephaly global developmental delay growth retardation and short stature
      and spastic quadriparesis. Dysmorphic facial features may be present including
      high-arched eyebrows flattened nasal root hypertelorism and long and smooth
      philtrum. Rhizomelia is not part of the syndrome. Cerebellar atrophy white matter
      abnormalities and Dandy-Walker malformation have been described on brain imaging.
