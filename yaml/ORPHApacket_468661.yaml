  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 74 is a rare genetic spastic
      paraplegia-optic atrophy-neuropathy-related (SPOAN-like) disorder characterized
      by childhood onset of mild to moderate spastic paraparesis which manifests with
      gait impairment that very slowly progresses into late adulthood hyperactive
      patellar reflex and bilateral extensor plantar response in association with
      optic atrophy and typical symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including reduced
      or absent ankle reflexes lower limb atrophy and distal sensory impairment. Reduced
      visual acuity and pes cavus are frequently reported.
