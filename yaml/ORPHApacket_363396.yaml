    Contents: High myopia-sensorineural deafness syndrome is a rare genetic disease
      characterized by high myopia typically ranging from -6.0 to -11.0 diopters and
      moderate to profound bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing loss with prelingual-onset.
      Affected individuals do not present other systemic ocular or connective tissue
      manifestations.
