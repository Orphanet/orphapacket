    Contents: LOC syndrome is a subtype of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB see
      this term) characterized by an altered cry in the neonatal period and by aberrant
      production of granulation tissue in particular affecting the upper airway tract
      conjunctiva and periungual/subungual sites.
