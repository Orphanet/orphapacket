    Contents: Hypermethioninemia due to glycine N-methyltransferase deficiency is
      a rare genetic inborn error of metabolism characterized by a relatively benign
      clinical phenotype with only mild to moderate hepatomegaly reported in addition
      to laboratory studies revealing permanent greatly increased hypermethioninemia
      mild to moderate elevation of aminotransferases and highly elevated plasma S-adenosyl-methionine
      with normal S-adenosylhomocysteine and total homocysteine.
