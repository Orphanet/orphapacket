  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary progressive apraxia of speech is a rare neurodegenerative disease
      characterized by impaired planning or programming of the movements for speech
      leading to phonetically and prosodically abnormal speech in absence at onset
      of any other neurological features (such as aphasia memory loss pyramidal signs).
      Patients usually present articulatory distortions/groping slow rate distorted
      sound substitutions and/or trial and error articulatory movements which begin
      insiduously and worsen over time.
