  Synonyms:
  - Synonym: Glucokinase-related hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of diffuse hyperinsulinism due to glucokinase hyperactivity and
      characterized by an excessive/ uncontrolled insulin secretion (inappropriate
      for the level of glycemia) and recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia induced by
      fasting and glucose rich meals. The clinical spectrum can range from mild and
      intermediate cases that respond well to dietary modifications and medical management
      with diazoxide to severe cases that are unresponsive to diazoxide. The potential
      development of type 2 diabetes with age is another notable feature.
