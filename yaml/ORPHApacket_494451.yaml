    Contents: A rare vulvar carcinoma characterized by a slowly growing ulcer or nodule
      which is histologically composed of demarcated nests of palisaded basal cells
      originating at the epidermal-dermal junction. Occasionally the tumor may be
      extensively pigmented. Patients most commonly present with pruritus. The lesion
      is usually treated by local excision although groin metastases have been reported.
