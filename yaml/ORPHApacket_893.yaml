  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder characterized by the association of complete
      or partial congenital aniridia (and associated eyes abnormalities) genitourinary
      anomalies (ranging from sexual ambiguity to ectopic testis) variable degrees
      of intellectual disability and an increased risk of developing Wilms tumors.
      A minority of patients develop kidney failure. Other variable findings may include
      obesity and duplicated halluces.
