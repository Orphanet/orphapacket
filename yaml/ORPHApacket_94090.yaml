  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 2 (PHP2) is a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism
      (PHP; see this term) characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      which manifests with hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH levels
      absence of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO; see this term) and normal
      expression of the Gs protein with a normal urinary cAMP response.
