  TextSection:
    Contents: Diprosopus is a rare life-threatening developmental defect during embryogenesis
      and a subtype of conjoined twins characterized by partial or complete duplication
      of the facial structures on a single head neck trunk and body. It may be associated
      with congenital anomalies involving the cardiovascular gastrointestinal respiratory
      and central nervous systems. Cleft lip and palate have been reported in rare
      cases.
