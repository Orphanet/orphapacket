  TextSection:
    Contents: An intermediate form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
      spectrum characterized by destruction and detachment of the skin epithelium
      involving between 10 to 29% of the body surface area and mucous membranes. Onset
      usually occurs 4-28 days after administration of the causal medication and is
      most frequently associated with anticonvulsants antibacterial sulfonamides allopurinol
      nevirapine and oxicams (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) but many other
      medications have also been implicated. The disease is not induced by medication
      in 15% of cases. Histology is characterized by an epidermal necrolysis. Multiple
      disabling long-term sequelae (especially cutaneous ocular and psychological)
      are frequent.
