  TextSection:
    Contents: Megacystic-megaureter syndrome is an urinary tract malformation characterized
      by the presence of a massive primary non-obstructive vesicoureteral reflux and
      a large capacity smooth thin walled bladder due to the continual recycling of
      refluxed urine. Recurrent urinary infections are commonly associated with this
      condition.
