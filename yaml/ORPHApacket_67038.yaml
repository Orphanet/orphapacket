  TextSection:
    Contents: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (see this term) and the most common form of leukemia in Western countries
      affecting elderly adults (mean age of 67 and 72 years) with a slight male predominance
      (1.7:1) and characterized by a highly variable clinical presentation that can
      include asymptomatic disease or non-specific B-symptoms such as unintentional
      weight loss severe fatigue fever (without evidence of infection) and night sweats
      as well as cervical lymphadenopathy splenomegaly and frequent infections. Some
      patients can also develop autoimmune complications such as autoimmune hemolytic
      anemia or immune thrombocytopenia (see these terms). The clinical course is
      extremely heterogeneous with survival ranging from a few months to several decades.
