      complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization or idiopathic
      primarily generalized epilepsy triggered by sexual orgasm. Seizures usually
      start immediately shortly after or a few hours after the achievement of orgasm
      last a few seconds or minutes and are followed in very rare cases by intense
