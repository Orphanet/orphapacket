  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome characterized
      by medullary thyroid carcinoma in association with pheochromocytoma (one or
      both adrenal glands can be affected) and/or primary hyperparathyroidism (caused
      by parathyroid adenoma). Onset is typically later than in MEN2B before 35 years
      of age. Diarrhea is the most frequent systemic symptom. Patients can develop
      Hirschsprung disease and less frequently cutaneous lichen amyloidosis or excessive
      production of adrenocorticotropic hormone.
