  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare endocrine disease characterized by the presence of serum autoantibodies
      against thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors leading to increased thyroid hormone
      production and secretion causing diffuse toxic goiter. Patients present in childhood
      with signs of thyrotoxicosis (such as tachycardia weight loss hand tremor and
      sweating) diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland and orbitopathy. Additional
      signs and symptoms include decreased academic and athletic performance accelerated
