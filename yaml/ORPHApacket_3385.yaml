  TextSection:
    Contents: Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) also called sleeping sickness is
      a vector-borne parasitic disease caused by a protozoa of the <i>Trypanosoma</i>
      genus transmitted by the bite of a tsetse fly (genus <i>Glossina</i>) that is
      found under its chronic form (average duration of 3 years) in western and central
      Africa (in case of the <i>T. brucei gambiense</i> sub-species) and under its
      acute form (lasting from few weeks to 6 months) in eastern and southern Africa
      (in case of the <i>T. brucei rhodesiense</i> sub-species). HAT comprises an
      initial hemo-lymphatic stage characterized by fever weakness musculoskeletal
      pain anemia and lymphadenopathy along with dermatologic cardiac and endocrine
      complications or hepatosplenomegaly followed by a meningo-encephalitic stage
      characterized by neurologic involvement (sleep disturbances psychiatric disorders
      seizures) that progresses in the absence of treatment towards a fatal meningoencephalitis.
