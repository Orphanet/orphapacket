  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease characterized by infection with the protozoans
      <i>Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense</i> (East African trypanosomiasis) or <i>T.
      brucei gambiense</i> (West African trypanosomiasis) usually due to the bite
      of an infected tsetse fly. The first hemolymphatic stage presents with fever
      headaches fatigue lymphadenopathy and aching muscles and joints. In East African
      trypanosomiasis the fly bite may develop into a red sore or chancre. This form
      then progresses to CNS invasion with somnolence and other neurologic and psychiatric
      symptoms within a few weeks while West African trypanosomiasis slowly progresses
      within about 3 years. Both forms are fatal if left untreated.
