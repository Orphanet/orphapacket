    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by moderate to severe developmental delay/intellectual disability with absent
      or limited speech development various behavioral problems (including autistic
      features hyperactivity or aggressiveness) and craniofacial anomalies such as
      long face high and prominent forehead bulbous nose with low-hanging columella
      thin vermillion of the upper lip palatal (cleft palate high-arched palate and
      bifid uvula) and dental (abnormal upper incisors) abnormalities and micrognathia.
      Hypotonia and feeding difficulties are frequent. Other supportive findings may
      include skeletal anomalies with low bone density and abnormal brain imaging.
