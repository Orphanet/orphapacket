  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare severe genetic intestinal disease characterized by congenital
      absence of heparan sulfate from small intestine epithelium manifesting with
      secretory diarrhea and massive enteric protein loss. Patients present intolerance
      to enteral feeds during the first few weeks to months of life. Apart from absence
      of heparan sulfate from the basolateral surface of small intestine enterocytes
      small bowel biopsy is otherwise normal.
