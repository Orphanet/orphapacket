  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a highly variable phenotype which ranges from a fatal neonatal/infantile
      encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis hyporeflexia/areflexia severe hypotonia
      and respiratory failure to less severe cases presenting with central hypotonia
      global developmental delay congenital sensorineural hearing loss and renal disease.
      Additional variably observed clinical features include intellectual disability
      seizures and cardiomyopathy.
