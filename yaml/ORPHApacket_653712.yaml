    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by developmental delay speech delay and variable degree of intellectual disability
      (mostly mid-to-moderate but some patients may also have normal intelligence)
      due to CHD4 gene mutations. Even though clinical manifestations are significantly
      variable among patients most patients manifest dysmorphic facial features (could
      sometimes include macrocephaly) congenital heart defects hypotonia and opthalmologic
      abnormalities. Other clinical features may include brain structure anomalies
      skeletal anomalies hearing impairment and hypogonadism (only in males).
