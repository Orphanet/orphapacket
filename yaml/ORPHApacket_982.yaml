  TextSection:
    Contents: Pulmonary valve agenesis is a rare congenital heart malformation characterized
      by a total or partial absence of the pulmonary valve leaflets associated with
      stenosis of the pulmonary artery orifice and aneurysmal dilatation of the pulmonary
      arteries. It usually occurs in association with additional cardiovascular malformations
      such as teralogy of fallot or ventricular septal defect or can occur as part
      of a syndrome (e.g. 22q11.2 deletion syndrome). Clinical features depend on
      the presence of associated cardiac malformations and include pulmonary insufficiency
      bronchial obstruction (secondary to compression by aneurysmally dilated pulmonary
      arteries) pulmonary stenosis cyanosis and cardiac failure.
