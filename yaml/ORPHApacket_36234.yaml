  TextSection:
    Contents: Bacterial toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a potentially fatal acute disease
      characterized by a sudden onset of high fever along with nausea myalgia vomiting
      and multisystem organ involvement potentially leading to shock and death. TSS
      is mediated by superantigenic toxins usually caused by an infection with <i>Staphylococcus
      aureus</i> in staphylococcal TSS (see this term) or <i>Streptococcus pyogenes</i>
      in streptococcal TSS (see this term).
