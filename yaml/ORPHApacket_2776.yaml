  TextSection:
    Contents: An early-onset distal osteolysis characterised by severe resorption
      of the hands and feet and absence of the distal and middle phalanges. It has
      been described in a son and daughter born to consanguineous parents. Other manifestations
      include distal muscular hypertrophy flexion contractures short stature mild
      intellectual deficit and characteristic facies (maxillary hypoplasia exophthalmos
      and a broad nasal tip). It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.
