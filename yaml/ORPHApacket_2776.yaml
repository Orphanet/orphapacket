  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary osteolysis characterized by severe distal osteolysis
      mild to moderate intellectual deficiency short stature and facial dysmorphism
      (including maxillary hypoplasia relative exophthalmos and broad nasal tip).
      Patients present with early-onset and rapidly progressive osteolysis manifests
      as severe resorption abnormalities in the hands and feet with absence of the
      distal and middle phalanges. Distal ulnar and radial epiphyses may also be affected.
      Joint limitation and flexion contractures of the elbows and knees have also
      been reported. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1993.
