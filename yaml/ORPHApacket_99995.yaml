  TextSection:
    Contents: Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) is a form of complex regional
      pain syndrome (see this term) in which the pain is disproportionate to any known
      inciting event and is characterized by continuous pain allodynia or hyperalgesia
      as well as edema coloration (changes in skin blood flow) or abnormal sudomotor
      activity in the region of pain. Onset of CRPS1 symptoms may occur within a few
      days to a month after an injury or trauma to the affected limb.
