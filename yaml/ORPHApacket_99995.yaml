    Contents: Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) is a form of complex regional
      pain syndrome in which the pain is disproportionate to any known inciting event
      and is characterized by continuous pain allodynia or hyperalgesia as well as
      edema coloration (changes in skin blood flow) or abnormal sudomotor activity
      in the region of pain. Onset of CRPS1 symptoms may occur within a few days to
      a month after an injury or trauma to the affected limb.
