  TextSection:
    Contents: MITF-related melanoma and renal cell carcinoma predisposition syndrome
      is an inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome due to a gain-of-function germline
      mutation in the MITF gene associated with a higher incidence of amelanotic and
      nodular melanoma multiple primary melanomas and increase in nevus number and
      size. It may also predispose to co-occurring melanoma and renal cell carcinoma
      and to pancreatic cancer.
