  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuroendocrine tumor arising from neural crest-derived paraganglion
      cells (most often in the para-aortic region at the level of renal hilia organ
      of Zuckerkandl thoracic paraspinal region bladder and carotid body) not associated
      with catecholamine secretion. These tumors are usually clinically silent and
      symptoms if present are nonspecific and depend on the location of the tumor.
      Association with certain hereditary cancer-predisposing syndromes such as multiple
      endocrine neoplasia neurofibromatosis type 1 or von Hippel lindau syndrome may
      be observed.
