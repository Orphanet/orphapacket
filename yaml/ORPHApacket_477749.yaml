  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral small vessel disease characterized by recurrent
      ischemic strokes often with a predilection for the pons with typical onset in
      the fourth or fifth decade of life. Patients present progressive cognitive and
      motor impairment with pyramidal bulbar and cerebellar symptoms among others.
      Brain imaging shows multiple lacunar infarcts typically with involvement of
      the pons as well as variable leukoencephalopathy of the cerebral hemispheres.
