  TextSection:
    Contents: RFT1-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by poorly coordinated suck resulting in difficulty feeding and
      failure to thrive; myoclonic jerks with hypotonia and brisk reflexes progressing
      to a seizure disorder; roving eyes; developmental delay; poor to absent visual
      contact; and sensorineural hearing loss. Additional features that may be observed
      include coagulation factor abnormalities inverted nipples and microcephaly.
      The disease is caused by mutations in the gene <i>RFT1</i> (3p21.1).
