  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by benign circumferential skin
      creases mainly on the limbs due to folding of excess skin. The creases often
      improve spontaneously in childhood. Patients also exhibit variable degrees of
      intellectual disability short stature cleft palate and facial dysmorphism (including
      epicanthal folds microphthalmia broad nasal bridge low-set posteriorly rotated
      ears and microstomia among others). Variable additional features have been reported
      such as seizures infantile hypotonia hearing impairment strabismus and urogenital
      anomalies. Brain imaging may show hypoplastic corpus callosum or mildly dilated
      ventricles.
