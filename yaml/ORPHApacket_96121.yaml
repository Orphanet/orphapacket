  TextSection:
    Contents: 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 7 characterized
      by a highly variable phenotype that typically manifests with mild-moderate intellectual
      delay (patients could be in the normal range) speech disorders (particularly
      of expressive language) and distinctive craniofacial features (brachycephaly
      broad forehead straight eyebows broad nasal tip short philtrum thin upper lip
      and facial asymmetry). Hypotonia developmental coordination disorders behavioral
      problems (such as anxiety ADHD and oppositional disorders) and various congenital
      anomalies such as heart defects diaphragmatic hernia renal malformations and
      cryptorchidism are frequently presented. Neurological abnormalities (visible
      on MRI) have been reported.
