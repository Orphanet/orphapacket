  TextSection:
    Contents: 7q11.23 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 7 characterized
      by a highly variable phenotype that typically manifests with mild to moderate
      intellectual disability (patients could be in the normal range) speech disorders
      (particularly of expressive language) and distinctive craniofacial features
      (brachycephaly broad forehead straight eyebows broad nasal tip short philtrum
      thin upper lip and facial asymmetry). Hypotonia developmental coordination disorders
      behavioral problems (such as anxiety ADHD and oppositional disorders) and various
      congenital anomalies such as heart defects diaphragmatic hernia renal malformations
      and cryptorchidism are frequently presented. Neurological abnormalities (visible
      on MRI) have been reported.
