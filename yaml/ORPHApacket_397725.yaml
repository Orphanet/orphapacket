    Contents: COASY protein-associated neurodegeneration (CoPAN) is a very rare slowly
      progressive form of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) characterized
      by classic NBIA features. The clinical manifestations include early-onset spastic-dystonic
      paraparesis oromandibular dystonia dysarthria parkinsonism axonal neuropathy
      progressive cognitive impairment complex motor tics and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder.
