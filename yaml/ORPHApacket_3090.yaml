  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis where some or all of
      the pulmonary veins drain into the right atrium or the systemic veins with or
      without the presence of pulmonary venous obstruction leading to various manifestations
      such as fatigue exertional dyspnea pulmonary arterial hypertension cyanosis
      and progressive congestive heart failure. The two main subtypes are congenital
      partial pulmonary venous return anomaly (PAPVC) where one or a few of the pulmonary
      veins are anomalous and congenital total pulmonary venous return anomaly (TAPVC)
      where all of the pulmonary veins are anomalous.
