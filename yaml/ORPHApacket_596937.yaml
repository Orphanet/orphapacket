    Contents: A rare vascular liver disease characterized by the absence of cirrhosis
      with or without portal hypertension and histological lesions involving portal
      venules or sinusoids. Patients may present either with specific clinical signs
      of portal hypertention (including gastric esophageal or ectopic varices portal
      hypertensive bleeding or porto-systemic collaterals at imaging) or a histological
      lesion specific to portosinusoidal vascular disease (including obliterative
      portal venopathy nodular regenerative hyperplasmia or incomplete septal fibrosis
      or cirrhosis) or they may manifest clinical signs that are not specific to portal
      hypertention (such as ascites platelet count <150.000/µl increased spleen size
      &#8805;13&nbsp;cm in the largest axis) together with a histological lesion including
      portal tract abnormalities irregular distribution of the portal tracts and central
      veins non-zonal sinusoidal dilation mild perisinusoidal fibrosis. Possible associations
      with altered immunity hematological diseases and prothrombotic conditions infections
      congenital or familial defects or drug exposure are reported.
