  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor characterized by a well-demarcated
      intraneural or diffusely infiltrative extraneural space-occupying lesion consisting
      of Schwann cells perineurial-like cells and fibroblasts. It presents as a cutaneous
      nodule a circumscribed mass in a peripheral nerve a plexiform enlargement of
      a major nerve trunk or with diffuse but localized involvement of skin and subcutaneous
      tissue. Multiple neurofibromas are typically associated with neurofibromatosis
      1. Malignant transformation occurs almost exclusively in plexiform neurofibromas
      and neurofibromas of major nerves.
