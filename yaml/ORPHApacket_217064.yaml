  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare intoxication caused by the prolonged low-dose administration
      of 5-fluorouracil which is the mainstay of both adjuvant and advanced-disease
      chemotherapy regimens in colon cancer. 5-fluorouracil poisoning is characterized
      by gastrointestinal (nausea emesis diarrhea anorexia stomatitis) and hematologic
      (myelosuppression) toxicities as well as mucositis alopecia and occasionally
      palmar-plantar dysesthesia (more commonly known as hand-foot syndrome). Women
      have been reported to experience more 5-fluorouracil-related toxicity than men.
