  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal anoctaminopathy is a rare autosomal recessive distal myopathy
      characterized by early adult-onset slowly progressive often asymmetrical lower
      limb muscle weakness initially affecting the calves (with relative anterior
      muscle sparing) and later proximal muscle involvement as well as highly elevated
      creatine kinase (CK) serum levels.
