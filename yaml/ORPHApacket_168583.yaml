  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary North American Indian childhood cirrhosis is a severe autosomal
      recessive intrahepatic cholestasis that has only been described in aboriginal
      children from northwestern Quebec. Manifesting first as transient neonatal jaundice
      the disease evolves into periportal fibrosis and cirrhosis during a period ranging
      from childhood to adolescence.
