    Contents: Distal trisomy 20q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from the partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 20 with high phenotypic
      variability mostly characterized by neurodevelopmental delay cardiac malformations
      (e.g. ventricular septal defect coarctation of aorta) and facial dysmorphism
      (incl. large/high forehead microphthalmia upslanting palpebral fissures epicanthus
      large long low-set ears anteverted nares protruding upper lip cleft lip/palate
      micro/retrognathia dimpled chin). Skeletal (brachydactyly scoliosis pectus excavatum)
      and cerebral anomalies have also been reported.
