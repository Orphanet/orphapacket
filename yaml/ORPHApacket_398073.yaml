    Contents: A rare group of multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by autism spectrum disorder developmental delay intellectual disability hyperphagia/obesity
      and short stature (clinical features overlapping with Prader-Willi syndrome).
      However it is a clinically and genetically heterogenous group where patients
      may completely lack or manifests in minority some classical clinical features
      of Prader-Willi syndrome such as short stature hypotonia hypogonadism hyperphagia
      and morbid obesity.
