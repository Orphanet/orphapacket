  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital vascular anomaly syndrome characterized by venous
      or on occasion arterial malformations which lead to soft tissue hypertrophy
      and bone hypoplasia. Affected limb is generally shortened highly deformed painful
      and edematous and associates bone and muscle hypotrophy. Single parts or multiple
      small parts of limbs are typically affected but more extensive involvement including
      complete extremity shoulder girdle and axilla has been reported.
