  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 32 (SPG32) is a rare complex
      type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by a slowly progressive
      spastic paraplegia (with walking difficulties appearing at onset at 6-7 years
      of age) associated with mild intellectual disability. Brain imaging reveals
      thin corpus callosum cortical and cerebellar atrophy and pontine dysraphia.
      The SPG32 phenotype has been mapped to a locus on chromosome 14q12-q21.
