  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by mostly posterior
      less frequently also anterior or lateral dislocation of the radial head from
      its position in the humeroradial joint. It is bilateral in the majority of cases
      and can occur as an isolated feature or in association with other congenital
      malformations and as part of a number of syndromes. The defect may at first
      cause only mild symptoms such as pain and limitation of flexion of the elbow
      but may eventually lead to joint instability dysplastic changes of the radial
      head and arthritis.
