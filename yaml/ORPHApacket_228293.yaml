  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis (PXE-PDE)
      is a rare acquired idiopathic dermal tissue disorder characterized by numerous
      asymptomatic 2-3 mm yellowish non-follicular papules that tend to converge into
      cobblestone-like plaques which are distributed symmetrically over the posterior
      neck supraclavicular region axillae and sometimes abdomen. Unlike PXE these
      skin lesions show select elimination (absence or marked loss) of elastic fibers
      in the papillary dermis and there is no systemic involvement.
