  TextSection:
    Contents: MAN1B1-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by intellectual disability delayed motor development hypotonia
      and truncal obesity. Additional features include slight facial dysmorphism (hypertelorism
      downslanting palpebral fissures large low-set ears hypoplastic nasolabial fold
      thin upper lip) hypermobility of the joints and skin laxity. The disease is
      caused by mutations in the gene <i>MAN1B1</i> (9q34.3).
