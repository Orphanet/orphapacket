  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuro-endocrino-cutaneous disorder characterized by highly
      variable degrees of alopecia moderate to severe intellectual disability progressive
      late-onset motor deterioration and combined anterior pituitary hormone deficiency
      manifesting with central hypogonadotropic hypogonadism delayed or absent puberty
      growth hormone deficiency (resulting in short stature) progressive central adrenal
      insufficiency and a hypoplastic anterior pituitary gland. Additional features
      include hypodontia flexural reticulate hyperpigmentation gynecomastia microcephaly
      and kyphoscoliosis.
