  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary bone dysplasia with increased bone density characterized
      by susceptibility to fractures after minor trauma anemia and characteristic
      skeletal radiographic changes such as sandwich vertebra bone-within-bone appearance
      Erlenmeyer-shaped femoral metaphysis and mild osteosclerosis of the skull base.
      Dental anomalies and visual impairment secondary to optic nerve compression
      have been rarely described.
