  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired peripheral neuropathy characterized by symmetric slowly
      progressive predominantly sensory neuropathy mostly limited to the legs with
      numbness and paresthesia of the distal leg and mild imbalance. Some patients
      may experience pain weakness of foot dorsiflexion mild proximal leg weakness
      and/or upper limb involvement. The majority of patients have IgG monoclonal
      gammopathy. Systemic illnesses are absent in most cases.
