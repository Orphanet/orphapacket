  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by congenital solitary or grouped
      red-to-purple plaques which may bleed and enlarge over time. The lesions show
      a predilection for the lower extremities. Histological examination reveals numerous
      dilated congested capillaries and venules in the papillary dermis often with
      a deep dermal component and with increased density of variably congested capillaries
      and venules also in the subcutaneous tissue. The overlying epidermis displays
      prominent acanthosis papillomatosis hyperkeratosis parakeratosis and crusting.
