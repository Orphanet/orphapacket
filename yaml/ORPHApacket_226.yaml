  TextSection:
    Contents: Dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR) deficiency is a severe form of hyperphenylalaninemia
      (HPA) due to impaired regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (see this term)
      leading to decreased levels of neurotransmitters (dopamine serotonin) and folate
      in cerebrospinal fluid and causing neurological symptoms such as psychomotor
      delay hypotonia seizures abnormal movements hypersalivation and swallowing difficulties.
