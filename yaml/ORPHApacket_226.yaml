  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydropterin (BH4) recycling
      deficiency leading to central dopamine and serotonin deficiency clinically characterized
      by infantile-onset neurological disease of variable severity ranging from mild
      forms with minor neurological development to severe forms with hypotonia developmental
      delay complex movement disorder dominated by dystonia or dystonia parkinsonism.
      Some patients may present refractory neurological symptoms like a degree of
      developmental delay epilepsy and brain abnormalities.
