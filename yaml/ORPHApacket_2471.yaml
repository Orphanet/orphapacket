  TextSection:
    Contents: McDonough syndrome is a rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic
      syndrome characterized by facial dysmorphism (prominent superciliary arcs synophrys
      strabismus large anteverted ears large nose malocclusion of teeth) delayed psychomotor
      development intellectual disability and congenital heart defects (e.g. pulmonic
      stenosis patent ductus arteriosus atrial septal defect). Additional features
      include thorax deformation (pectus excavatum/carinatum) kyphoscoliosis diastasis
      recti and cryptorchidism. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1984.
