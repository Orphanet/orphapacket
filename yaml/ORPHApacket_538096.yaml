  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory
      neuropathy disease characterized by prenatal onset of a severe sensorimotor
      axonal polyneuropathy (reflected by reduced fetal movement and polyhydramnios)
      manifesting at birth with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation
      profound muscular hypotonia rapidly progressing distal muscle weakness and absent
      deep tendon reflexes in the absence of contractures leading to death before
      8 months of age. Neuropathological findings show severe loss of large- and medium-sized
      myelinated fibers without signs of demyelination.
