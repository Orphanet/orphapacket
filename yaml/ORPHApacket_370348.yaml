  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare aggressive malignant neoplastic disease characterized by a usually
      ill-defined solid multilobulated mass frequently having necrosis located on
      any site of the body (except the central nervous system) composed of small round
      poorly differentiated cells with or without Homer-Wright rosettes showing varying
      degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation. Manifestations are variable depending
      on location with osteolytic destruction being common when arising from bone.
