  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare constitutional hemolytic anemia due to a red cell membrane anomaly
      characterized by lack or severe reduction of Rh blood group antigens resulting
      in increased osmotic fragility of red blood cells and chronic hemolytic anemia
      of varying severity with stomatocytosis and spherocytosis. Two types of the
      syndrome arising from independent genetic mechanisms have been distinguished:
      the regulator type is caused by defects of the Rh associated glycoprotein (encoded
      by the <i>RHAG</i> gene) while the amorph type is due to mutations at the <i>RH</i>
      locus itself.'
