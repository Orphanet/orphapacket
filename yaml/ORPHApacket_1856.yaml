  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondyloperipheral dysplasia-short ulna syndrome is a rare genetic primary
      bone dysplasia with highly variable phenotype typically characterized by platyspondyly
      brachydactyly type E changes (short metacarpals and metatarsals short distal
      phalanges in hands and feet) bilateral short ulnae and mild short stature. Other
      reported features include additional skeletal findings (e.g. midface hypoplasia
      degenerative changes in proximal femora limited elbow extension bilateral sacralization
      of L5 clubfeet) as well as myopia hearing loss and intellectual disability.
