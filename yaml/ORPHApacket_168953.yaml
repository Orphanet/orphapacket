  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation
      of myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring translocations or insertions
      involving the chromosome band 8p11 and the FGFR1 gene in the blood bone marrow
      and often other tissues as well (spleen liver lymph nodes breast etc.). It usually
      presents as myeloproliferative neoplasm with eosinophilia T lymphoblastic lymphoma
      with eosinophilia or less frequently acute myeloid leukemia. The presenting
      signs and symptoms include eosinophilia leukocytosis with leukemoid reaction
      monocytosis fatigue sweating weight loss lymphadenopathy splenomegaly and/or
