    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by absence of the hepatic segment
      of the inferior vena cava and presence of an enlarged azygos vein (or in rare
      cases hemiazygos vein if there is a left-sided inferior vena cava) draining
      the venous blood from the caudal segments. The post-hepatic segment of the inferior
      vena cava is present draining only the hepatic veins into the right atrium.
      Most patients remain asymptomatic if the anomaly is isolated. Association with
      congenital heart disease and asplenia or polysplenia syndromes has been reported.
