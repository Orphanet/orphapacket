  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-deafness-intellectual disability syndrome
      is a rare demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized
      by early-onset slowly progressive distal muscular weakness and atrophy with
      no sensory impairment congenital sensorineural deafness and mild intellectual
      disability (with absence of normal speech development). The absence of large
      myelinated fibers on sural nerve biopsy is equally characteristic of the disease.
