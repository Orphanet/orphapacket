  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by severe short stature and craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly narrow face
      with flat cheeks ptosis prominent nose with a convex ridge low-set ears with
      small or absent lobes high-arched/cleft palate micrognathia) associated with
      premature graying and loss of scalp hair redundant dry and wrinkled skin of
      the palms premature senility and varying degrees of intellectual disability.
      Cryptorchidism and skeletal anomalies may also be observed. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1970.
