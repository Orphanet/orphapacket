  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by infantile onset truncal
      ataxia/hypotonia athetosis generalized seizures and ophthalmologic abnormalities
      notably optic atrophy and retinal degeneration (strabismus nystagmus abnormal
      eye movements and abnormal pursuit can also be present). Additional clinical
      features may include cerebral changes (thinning of the corpus callosum dysmyelination
      and frontal and temporal cortical atrophy) severely delayed global and psychomotor
      development with profound intellectual disability failure to thrive muscle atrophy
      and hyperreflexia. Most patients are not able to walk. Some patients may have
      milder and variable phenotype including mild developmental delay ataxia and
      behavioral abnormalities. Short stature moderate to severe sensorineural hearing
      loss dysmorphic facial features (including prominent forehead downslanting palpebral
      fissures droopy eyelids bifid uvula submucous cleft palate) are also reported
      in some patients.
