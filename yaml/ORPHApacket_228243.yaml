  TextSection:
    Contents: Elastofibroma dorsi is a rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder
      characterized by a benign slowly progressive often bilateral non-encapsulated
      lesion usually presenting as an ill-defined mass under the inferior angle of
      the scapula (but other locations have been reported) which adheres to the deep
      layers and presents no local signs of inflammation. It is commonly asymptomatic
      and discovered inadvertently but symptoms may include pain and discomfort or
      stiffness when using the shoulder. The presence of a firm mass masked by the
      scapula during retropulsion of the shoulder and becoming prominent when the
      shoulder is displaced toward the front is a frequent sign. Neuromuscular involvement
      of the upper limb may occur in rare cases.
