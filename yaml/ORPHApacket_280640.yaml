  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral malformation characterized by the presence of
      cortical smoothening with loss of secondary and tertiary gyri associated with
      an excessive number of small irregular gyri with increased cortical thickness
      located in the occipital lobes. Patients usually present with seizures (including
      myoclonic-astatic absence atypical absence vision loss myoclonic-atonic generalized
      tonic-clonic) and variable (absent to moderate) developmental and/or intellectual
      delay.
