  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 14 is a rare complex hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by adulthood-onset of slowly progressive spastic
      paraplegia of lower limbs presenting with spastic gait hyperreflexia and mild
      lower limb hypertonicity associated with mild intellectual disability visual
      agnosia short and long-term memory deficiency and mild distal motor neuropathy.
      Bilateral pes cavus and extensor plantar responses are also associated.
