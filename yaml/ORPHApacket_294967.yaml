    Contents: A rare non-syndromic limb reduction defect characterized by complete
      or near-complete congenital absence of one (unilateral) or both (bilateral)
      of the upper extremities occurring due to an intrauterine insult during the
      very early stages of embryonic development. It may be an isolated anomaly but
      is more commonly observed in combination with multiple other congenital malformations.
