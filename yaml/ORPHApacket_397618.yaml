  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic eye disease characterized by foveal hypoplasia optic
      nerve misrouting with an increased number of axons decussating at the optic
      chiasm and innervating the contralateral cortex and posterior embryotoxon or
      Axenfeld anomaly (indicating anterior segment dysgenesis) in the absence of
      albinism. Patients present congenital nystagmus decreased visual acuity refractive
      errors and ocassionally strabismus. Microphthalmia and retinochoroidal coloboma
      may also be associated.
