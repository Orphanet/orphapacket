  TextSection:
    Contents: Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by the dimorphic fungus <i>Sporothrix
      schenckii</i> generally occurring by traumatic inoculation of fungus from contaminated
      soil plants and organic matter that has a highly variable disease spectrum but
      that usually presents as a subcutaneous mycosis with a single sporotrichotic
      chancre that may ulcerate and can then progress to lymphocutaneous (most common
      form; sporotrichotic chancre at inoculation site and a string of similar nodules
      along the proximal lymphatics) fixed cutaneous (localized asymptomatic erythematous
      papules at the inoculation site) or multifocal or disseminated cutaneous (rare
      form with 3 or more lesions involving 2 different anatomical sites) forms. Pulmonary
      sporotrichosis occurs following inhalation of fungus and manifests as chronic
      pneumonitis while extracutaneous or systemic sporotrichosis (with osteoarticular
      pulmonary and central nervous system/meningeal disease) has also been reported
      usually occurring in the setting of immunosuppression.
