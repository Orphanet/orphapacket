  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic constitutional thrombocytopenia characterized by thrombocytopenia
      with increased bleeding tendency (leading to epistaxis menorrhagia and petechiae)
      in combination with myelofibrosis and splenomegaly. Platelets may be abnormally
      large or small and partly hypo- or agranular plasma thrombopoietin is elevated
      and the number of megakaryocytes in the bone marrow increased. Additional non-hematologic
      manifestations have been described in some patients including mild bone abnormalities
      and facial dysmorphism with large forehead hypertelorism deep-set eyes and wide
      nostrils.
