  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases
      (MSMD) due to partial IFNgammaR2 deficiency is a genetic variant of MSMD characterized
      by a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR2 leading to a residual response to IFN-gamma
      and consequently to recurrent moderately severe infections with bacillus Calmette-Guérin
      (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria (EM).
