  TextSection:
    Contents: "Autosomal recessive mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases\
      \ (MSMD) due to partial IFNgammaR2 deficiency is a genetic variant of MSMD (see\
      \ this term) characterized by a partial deficiency in IFN-gammaR2 leading to\
      \ a residual response to IFN-gamma and consequently to recurrent moderately\
      \ severe infections with bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) and other environmental\
      \ mycobacteria (EM)."
