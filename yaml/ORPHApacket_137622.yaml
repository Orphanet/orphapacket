  TextSection:
    Contents: Intractable diarrhea-choanal atresia-eye anomalies syndrome is characterised
      by the association of intractable diarrhoea of infancy with choanal atresia.
      Short stature a prominent and broad nasal bridge micrognathia single palmar
      creases chronic corneal inflammation cytopenia and abnormal hair texture were
      also reported. So far the syndrome has been described in three children from
      the same family. The absence of intellectual deficit and immune deficiency allow
      this syndrome to be distinguished from other forms of intractable diarrhoea
      of infancy described previously.
