    Contents: Congenital supravalvular mitral ring is a rare congenital mitral valve
      malformation characterized by an abnormal ridge of the connective tissue on
      the atrial side of the mitral valve which can present clinically with signs
      and symptoms of left ventricle inflow obstruction (dyspnea tachypnea pulmonary
      hypertension right ventricle hypertrophy pulmonary edema). Association with
      other mitral valve anomalies aortic stenosis ventricular septal defect patent
      ductus arteriosus double-outlet right ventricle pulmonary hypertension and Shone
