  TextSection:
    Contents: FRAXF syndrome was originally identified in a family with developmental
      delay and an expanded CCG repeat at the folate-sensitive FRAXF fragile site.
      Since this initial description FRAXF has been associated with a range of manifestations
      but no clear phenotype has been established.
