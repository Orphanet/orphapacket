    Contents: MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young) is a rare familial clinically
      and genetically heterogeneous form of diabetes characterized by young age of
      onset (generally 10-45 years of age) with maintenance of endogenous insulin
      production lack of pancreatic beta-cell autoimmunity absence of obesity and
      insulin resistance and extra-pancreatic manifestations in some subtypes.
