  TextSection:
    Contents: Trisomy 4p is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from the
      partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 4 with a highly variable
      phenotype typically characterized by pre- and postnatal growth delay psychomotor
      developmental delay and craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly prominent glabelle
      hypertelorism enlarged ears with abnormal helix and antihelix bulbous nose with
      flat or depressed nasal bridge long philtrum retrognathia with pointed chin).
      Additional features include skeletal (rocker bottom feet arachnodactyly camptodactyly)
      and renal malformations cardiac defects ocular abnormalities and abnormal genitalia
      in males.
