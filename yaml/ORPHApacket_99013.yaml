  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary spastic ataxia characterized by an onset usually
      in adulthood (but ranging from 10-72 years) of progressive bilateral lower limb
      weakness and spasticity and sometimes predominant cerebellar ataxia. In addition
      to frequent sphincter dysfunction and decreased vibratory sense at the ankles
      manifestations may include optical neuropathy nystagmus blepharoptosis ophthalmoplegia
      decreased hearing scoliosis <i>pes cavus</i> motor and sensory neuropathy muscle
      atrophy parkinsonism and dystonia.
