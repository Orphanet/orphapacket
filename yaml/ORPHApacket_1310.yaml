  TextSection:
    Contents: Caffey disease is an osteosclerotic dysplasia characterized by acute
      inflammation with massive subperiosteal new bone formation usually involving
      the diaphyses of the long bones as well as the ribs mandible scapulae and clavicles.
      The disease is associated with fever irritability pain and soft tissue swelling
      with onset around the age of 2 months and resolving spontaneously by the age
      of 2 years. However prenatal disease onset has also been described.
