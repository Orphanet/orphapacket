  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by the presence of
      two or more of the main criteria for classic Rett syndrome (loss of acquired
      purposeful hand skills loss of acquired spoken language gait abnormalities stereotypic
      hand movements) a period of regression followed by recovery or stabilization
      and five out of eleven supportive criteria (breathing difficulties bruxism impaired
      sleep pattern abnormal muscle tone peripheral vasomotor disturbances scoliosis/kyphosis
      delayed growth small cold hands and feet inappropriate laughter or screaming
      spells decreased pain sensation and intense eye communication). Like classic
      Rett syndrome it almost exclusively affects girls while the disease course may
      be either milder or more severe.
