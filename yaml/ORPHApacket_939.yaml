  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare classic organic aciduria characterized by tissue accumulation
      and elevation of urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisobutyric acid. The clinical
      phenotype ranges from recurrent mild episodes of vomiting with normal cognitive
      development to massive acidosis seizures and failure to thrive with profound
      intellectual disability and early death. Dysmorphic craniofacial features (such
      as microcephaly triangular face short sloping forehead long prominent philtrum
      and micrognathia) and variable cerebral anomalies have also been described.
