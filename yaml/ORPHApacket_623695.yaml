    Contents: A rare skeletal dysplasia characterized by disproportionate short stature
      with short limbs small hands and feet and midface hypoplasia with small nose.
      Mild spondylar dysplasia delayed epiphyseal ossification of the hip and knee
      and severe brachydactyly with cone shaped phalangeal epiphyses are characteristic
      features. In adulthood premature spondylosis and degenerative joint disease
      develop in some patients. Frequent respiratory infections with prolonged cough
