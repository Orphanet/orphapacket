  TextSection:
    Contents: Infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 is a rare and severe chronic
      disease characterized by recurrent chronic eczema (with erythematous scaly and
      crusted lesions) mainly affecting seborrheic areas (e.g. scalp forehead eyelids
      paranasal and periauricular skin neck axillae and groin) a generalized fine
      papular rash chronic nasal discharge with crusting of the anterior nares and
      non-virulent <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> or beta-hemolytic <i>Streptococcus</i>
      infections thought to be a result of HTLV-1-induced immunosuppression. Lymphadenopathy
      anemia mild to moderate pruritus and increased incidence of other infections
      (e.g. crusted scabies) have also been reported in some patients. Patients may
      subsequently develop other HTLV-1 associated conditions such as adult T-cell
      leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis.
