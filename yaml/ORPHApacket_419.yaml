  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of proline metabolism characterized biochemically by
      markedly elevated levels of proline in plasma and urine due to deficiency of
      proline oxidase. The reported clinical phenotype ranges from asymptomatic to
      variable neurologic and psychiatric manifestations (including global developmental
      delay seizures autistic features and hyperactivity).
