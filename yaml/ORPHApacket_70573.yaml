  TextSection:
    Contents: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive malignant neoplasm
      accounting for 10-15% of lung cancer cases characterized by rapid growth and
      early metastasis. SCLC usually manifests as a large hilar mass with bulky mediastinal
      lymphadenopathy presenting clinically with chest pain persistent cough dyspnea
      wheezing hoarseness hemoptysis loss of appetite weight loss and neurological
      and endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes. SCLC is primarily reported in elderly
      people with a history of long-term tobacco exposure.
