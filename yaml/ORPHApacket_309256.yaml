  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of Metachromatic leukodystrophy characterized by rapidly progressive
      psychomotor regression with an onset before 30 months of age after a period
      of apparently normal development. Manifestations developing during the course
      of the disease are impaired feeding and swallowing due to pseudobulbar palsies
      seizures painful spasms muscle weakness ataxia paralysis dementia and loss of
      speech vision and hearing quickly resulting in complete loss of motor and cognitive
      skills and decerebration. Death occurs within the first decade of life.
