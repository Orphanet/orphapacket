  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by onset of episodic developmental
      regression in the first year of life often in the setting of febrile illnesses
      as well as hypotonia and seizures or refractory epileptic encephalopathy. Other
      observed features include ataxia dystonia or optic atrophy among others. Patients
      do not achieve independent ambulation or meaningful speech. Brain imaging may
      show progressive cerebellar or diffuse atrophy and signal abnormalities of the
      basal ganglia. Serum lactate is often elevated.
