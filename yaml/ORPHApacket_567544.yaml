  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare idiopathic glomerular clinical syndrome characterized by diffuse
      renal lesions that are indistinguishable from the lesions observed in systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) in the absence of circulating autoantibodies and other
      systemic features necessary to meet the classification criteria for SLE. Patients
      may present with nephrotic syndrome abnormal urinary sediment acute renal insufficiency
      progressive glomerulonephritis and hypertension. Some patients have been reported
      to develop a progression to SLE over time.
