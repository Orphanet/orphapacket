  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial spontaneous pneumothorax is a rare genetic pulmonary disease
      characterized by the uni- or bilateral accumulation of air in the pleural cavity
      in persons with a positive family history and no underlying lung disease or
      previous chest trauma. Patients typically present dyspnea associated with acute
      onset of sharp and steady pleutiric chest pain of variable severity (which resolves
      within 24h even though pneumothorax is still present). Reflex tachycardia and/or
      respiratory or circulatory compromise may be observed. Other syndromes (e.g.
      Birt-Hogg-Dube Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes) may be associated.
