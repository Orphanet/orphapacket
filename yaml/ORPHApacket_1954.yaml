  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disorder characterized by erythrodermic peeling skin from
      birth with no obvious nail or hair-shaft abnormalities and other associated
      anomalies including diarrhea failure to thrive and severe hypoalbuminaemia resistant
      to correction by enteral or intravenous supplementation. An autosomal recessive
      mode of inheritance is highly probable. The prognosis is poor and infants die
      in the first months of life. There have been no further descriptions in the
      literature since 1992.
