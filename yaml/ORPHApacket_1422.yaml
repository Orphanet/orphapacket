  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare difference of sex development affecting 46,XY individuals and
      characterized by complete gonadal dysgenesis (normal external female genitalia
      lack of pubertal development primary amenorrhea and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism)
      in association with severe dwarfism with generalized chondrodysplasia (bell-shaped
      thorax micromelia brachydactyly). Other reported features in the live sibling
      included eye anomalies (hypoplastic irides myopia coloboma of optic discs) dysmorphic
      features (deep-set eyes upslanting palpebral fissures puffy eyelids large ears
      and mouth mild prognathism) muscular hypoplasia mild intellectual deficiency
      and severe microcephaly with cerebellar vermis hypoplasia.
