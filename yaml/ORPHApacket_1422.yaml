  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of sex development affecting 46,XY individuals and characterized
      by complete gonadal dysgenesis (normal external female genitalia lack of pubertal
      development primary amenorrhea and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism) in association
      with severe dwarfism with generalized chondrodysplasia (bell-shaped thorax micromelia
      brachydactyly). Other reported features in the live sibling included eye anomalies

      eyes upslanting palpebral fissures puffy eyelids large ears and mouth mild prognathism)
      muscular hypoplasia mild intellectual deficiency and severe microcephaly with
