  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a clonal proliferation
      of eosinophilic precursors with persistent increase of eosinophils in peripheral
      blood and bone marrow accompanied by increased blasts (<20%) or clonal cytogenetic
      or molecular genetic abnormalities. Cases with BCR-ABL1 PCM1-JAK2 ETV6-JAK2
      or BCR-JAK2 fusion or rearrangement of PDGFRA PDGFRB or FGFR1 are not included
      in this entity. Infiltration of the liver and spleen as well as a variety of
      other organs is typical. Patients may present with constitutional symptoms and
      signs and symptoms of organ involvement such as endomyocardial fibrosis peripheral
      neuropathy central nervous system manifestations respiratory symptoms or rheumatological
      findings. Acute transformation is common.
