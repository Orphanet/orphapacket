  TextSection:
    Contents: "A rare gastroenterologic disease characterized by the histopathological\
      \ finding of a thickened (> 10 \xB5m) gastric subepithelial collagen layer in\
      \ association with an inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. Patients\
      \ typically present with upper abdominal pain and severe iron deficiency anemia.\
      \ The condition is not commonly associated with autoimmune diseases and involvement\
      \ of the colon is less frequent than in the adult form. The disease takes a\
      \ generally benign course with limited long-term morbidity and no increased\
      \ mortality."
