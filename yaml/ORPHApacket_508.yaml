  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of <i>INSR</i>-related severe insulin resistance characterized
      by severe intrauterine growth retardation postnatal failure to thrive dysmorphic
      features extreme insulin resistance fluctuating blood glucose levels. The life
      expectancy is very short with death usually occurring during infancy due to
      metabolic complications cardiomyopathy and/or infections.
