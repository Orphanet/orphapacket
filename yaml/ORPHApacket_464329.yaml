  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly or angioma characterized by multifocal malformed
      lymphatic channels lined by clusters or sheets of spindled lymphatic endothelial
      cells with a predilection for the thoracic cavity but also involving extra-thoracic
      locations especially bones and spleen. Typical clinical signs and symptoms are
      pericardial and pleural effusions cough dyspnea bleeding and fractures secondary
      to bone involvement. Prognosis is generally poor due to the progressive nature
      of the condition.
