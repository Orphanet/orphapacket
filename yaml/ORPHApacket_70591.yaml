  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare complication of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) either symptomatic
      or not that is characterized by fibrotic intravascular material occlusion of
      pulmonary arteries in combination with a secondary microvasculopathy of vessels
      less than 500 &#181;m. The consequence is an increase in pulmonary vascular
      resistance (PVR) and progressive right heart failure.
