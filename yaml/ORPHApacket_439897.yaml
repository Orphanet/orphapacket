    Contents: Lethal fetal cerebrorenogenitourinary agenesis/hypoplasia syndrome is
      a rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis malformation syndrome
      characterized by intrauterine growth restriction flexion arthrogryposis of all
      joints severe microcephaly renal cystic dysplasia/agenesis/hypoplasia and complex
      malformations of the brain (cerebral and cerebellar hypoplasia vermis corpus
      callosum and/or occipital lobe agenesis with or without arhinencephaly) as well
      as of the genitourinary tract (ureteral agenesis/hypoplasia uterine hypoplasia
      and/or vaginal atresia) leading to fetal demise.
