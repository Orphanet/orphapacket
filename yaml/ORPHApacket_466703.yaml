  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by chronic
      non-progressive liver disease manifesting as mild steatosis with elevated serum
      transaminases and alkaline phosphatase hypercholesterolemia and decreased coagulation
      factors and ceruloplasmin. Transferrin glycosylation pattern is consistent with
      a type 2 congenital disorder of glycosylation. Liver biopsy may show mild non-progressive
      fibrosis. Patients usually remain asymptomatic although delayed psychomotor
      development and hypotonia have been reported in single cases.
