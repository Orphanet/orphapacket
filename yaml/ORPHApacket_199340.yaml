  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myofibrillar myopathy characterized by childhood-/adolescent-onset
      progressive myopathy with proximal and/or distal muscle weakness that commonly
      progress to involve axial muscles due to <i>BAG3</i> mutations. Patients present
      with toe-walking gait disturbance fatigue rigid spine scoliosis and joint contractures
      (particularly of the knees ankles and hips). Respiratory insufficiency and cardiomyopathy
      are frequently present. All patients exhibit a sensorimotor axonal/demyelinating
      (often with giant axons) peripheral neuropathy contributing to distal weakness
      and sensory loss. Disease typically progress rapidly in childhood-/adolescent-onset
      patient however few adult-onset patients reported to have milder slower progression
      with limited cardiac or respiratory involvement.
