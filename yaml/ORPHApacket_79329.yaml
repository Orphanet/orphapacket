  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of disorder of protein N-glycosylation characterized by
      facial dysmorphism (large posteriorly rotated ears with prominent antihelices
      convex nasal ridge open mouth large and crowded teeth) stereotypic hand movements
      seizures and varying degrees of developmental delay. A bleeding tendency is
      also observed and this results from diminished platelet aggregation. The disease
      is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene <i>MGAT2</i> (14q21).
