    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by mild to severe intellectual disability frequently co-occuring with behavioral
      problems (including anxiety attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autistic
      spectrum disorder) variable somatic overgrowth macrocephaly and distinctive
      dysmorphic facial features including high hairline frontal bossing downslanting
      palpebral fissures telecanthus hypertelorism deep-set eyes and full cheeks.
