  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mosaic form of NF2-related schwannomatosis characterized by findings
      typical of NF2-related schwannomatosis namely development of multiple benign
      nerve sheath tumors called schwannomas particularly affecting the vestibular
      nerve. Mosaic form is caused by postzygotic pathogenic variants in NF2. In mosaic
      NF2-related schwannomatosis the allelic/tissue distribution of the pathogenic
      NF2 variant clearly suggests mosaicism. The phenotype can be milder than in
      NF2-related schwannomatosis.
