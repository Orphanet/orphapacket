  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by tall
      stature due to postnatal overgrowth mild to moderate intellectual disability
      joint hypermobility and subtle distinctive facial features which often become
      apparent during adolescence (such as round face low-set thick horizontal eyebrows
      narrow palpebral fissures and prominent upper-central incisors). Overweight
      hypotonia behavioral and psychiatric problems are common. Other clinical features
      may involve seizures cryptorchidism and cardiovascular diseases (including congenital
      heart disease and aortic root dilatation).
