    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by multiple lateral
      meningoceles distinctive facial dysmorphism (including hypertelorism downslanting
      palpebral fissures posteriorly rotated ears micrognathia and high narrow palate
      among others) and skeletal abnormalities (e. g. vertebral anomalies wormian
      bones short stature and scoliosis). Multiple additional features may present
      such as conductive hearing impairment hypotonia and connective tissue and urogenital
      abnormalities. Cognition is usually normal.
