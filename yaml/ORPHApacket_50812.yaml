  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism similar
      to that seen in Zellweger syndrome (see this term) such as frontal bossing high
      forehead upslanting palpebral fissures hypoplastic supraorbital ridges and epicanthal
      folds and in addition pale skin profound hypotonia developmental delay and minor
      metabolic anomalies. No peroxysomal defects however have been reported. Transmission
      is thought to be autosomal recessive.
