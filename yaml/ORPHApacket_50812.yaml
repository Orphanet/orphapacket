  TextSection:
    Contents: Zellweger-like syndrome without peroxisomal anomalies is an extremely
      rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism similar to that
      seen in Zellweger syndrome (see this term) such as frontal bossing high forehead
      upslanting palpebral fissures hypoplastic supraorbital ridges and epicanthal
      folds and in addition pale skin profound hypotonia developmental delay and minor
      metabolic anomalies. No peroxysomal defects however have been reported. Transmission
      is thought to be autosomal recessive.
