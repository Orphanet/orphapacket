  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism similar
      to that seen in Zellweger syndrome such as frontal bossing high forehead upslanting
      palpebral fissures hypoplastic supraorbital ridges and epicanthal folds and
      in addition pale skin profound hypotonia developmental delay and minor metabolic
      anomalies. No peroxisomal defects however have been reported. Transmission is
      thought to be autosomal recessive.
