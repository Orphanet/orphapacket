  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of zinc metabolism characterized by recurrent infections
      hepatosplenomegaly anemia (unresponsive to iron supplementation) and chronic
      systemic inflammation in the presence of high plasma concentrations of zinc
      and calprotectin. Patients typically present dermal ulcers or other cutaneous
      manifestations (e.g. inflammation) and arthralgia. Severe epistaxis and spontaneous
      hematomas have also been reported.
