    Contents: 'Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Handigodu type is a rare genetic primary
      bone dysplasia disorder characterized by three distinct phenotypes namely: 1)
      patients of average height with painful osteoarthritic changes of the hip joints
      and no spinal abnormalities 2) short-statured patients with predominantly truncal
      shortening arm span exceeding height dysplastic changes of hips and varying
      degrees of platyspondyly and 3) patients with dwarfism various associated skeletal
      abnormalities (particularly of the knees and hands) and severe epiphyseal dysplasia
      (of hips knees hands wrists) associated with significant platyspondyly. Most
      patients cannot walk long distances and many have decreased joint spaces as
      well as sclerotic and cystic changes on imaging.'
