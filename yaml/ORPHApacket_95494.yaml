  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital hypopituitarism is characterized by multiple pituitary hormone
      deficiency including somatotroph thyrotroph lactotroph corticotroph or gonadotroph
      deficiencies. Congenital hypopituitarism is rare compared with the high incidence
      of hypopituitarism induced by pituitary adenomas transsphenoidal surgery or
      radiotherapy.
