  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital hypopituitarism is characterized by multiple pituitary hormone
      deficiency including somatotroph thyrotroph lactotroph corticotroph or gonadotroph
      deficiencies due to mutations of pituitary transcription factors involved in
      pituitary ontogenesis. Congenital hypopituitarism is rare compared with the
      high incidence of hypopituitarism induced by pituitary adenomas transsphenoidal
      surgery or radiotherapy.
