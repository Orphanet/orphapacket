  TextSection:
    Contents: Smith-McCort dysplasia (SMC) is a rare spondylo-epi-metaphyseal dysplasia
      characterized by the clinical manifestations of coarse facies short neck short
      trunk dwarfism with barrel-shaped chest and rhizomelic limb shortening as well
      as specific radiological features (i.e. generalized platyspondyly with double-humped
      vertebral end plates and iliac crests with a lace-like appearance) and normal
      intelligence. The clinical and skeletal features are similar to those seen in
      the allelic disorder Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen syndrome (DMC; see this term) but
      can be distinguished from this syndrome by the absence of intellectual deficiency
      and microcephaly in SMC.
