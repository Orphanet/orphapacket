  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease characterized by chronic inflammation of unknown
      etiology and occurring predominantly in males in the second to third decades
      of life mainly in Southeast Asian countries. Patients present with painless
      soft tissue swelling most commonly involving the head and neck region usually
      with salivary gland involvement (parotid and submandibular glands) and regional
      lymphadenopathy. Frequent laboratory findings are peripheral eosinophilia and
      raised serum IgE. The diagnosis is confirmed histopathologically by the presence
      of well-formed lymphoid follicles with eosinophilic infiltration and vascular
      proliferation in the biopsy.
