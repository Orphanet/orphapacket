  TextSection:
    Contents: Ectodermal dysplasia-intellectual disability-central nervous system
      malformation syndrome is a rare multiple developmental anomalies syndrome characterized
      by the triad of ectodermal dysplasia (mostly hypohidrotic with dry skin and
      reduced sweating and sparse fair scalp hair eyebrows and eyelashes) severe intellectual
      disability and variable central nervous system anomalies (cerebellar hypoplasia
      dilatation of ventricles corpus callosum agenesis Dandy-Walker malformation).
      Distinct craniofacial dysmorphism with macrocephaly frontal bossing midfacial
      hypoplasia and high arched or cleft palate as well as cryptorchidism feeding
      difficulties and hypotonia are associated. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1998.
