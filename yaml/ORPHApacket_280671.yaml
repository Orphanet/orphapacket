    Contents: A rare genetic skeletal muscle disease characterized by an early-onset
      hypotonia muscle weakness global developmental delay with intellectual disability
      and cardiomyopathy. Congenital structural heart defects and ichthyosiform cutaneous
      lesions have also been associated. Muscle biopsy shows characteristic enlarged
      mitochondria located at the periphery of muscle fibers.
