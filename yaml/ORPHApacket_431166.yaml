  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary immunodeficiency with post-measles-mumps-rubella vaccine viral
      infection is a rare primary immunodeficiency due to a defect in innate immunity
      disorder characterized by selective susceptibility to viral infections particularly
      after systemic challenge with live viral vaccines such as the measles mumps
      and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Patients present severe potentially fatal manifestations
      to viral illness including encephalitis hepatitis and pneumonitis.
