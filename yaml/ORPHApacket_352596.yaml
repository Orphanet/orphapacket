  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive myoclonic epilepsy with dystonia is a rare genetic epilepsy
      syndrome characterized by neonatal or early infantile onset of severe progressive
      typically frequent and prolonged myoclonic seizures that are refractory to treatment
      associated with localized and/or generalized paroxysmal dystonia (which later
      becomes persistent). Other features include severe hypotonia hemiplegia psychomotor
      regression (or lack of psychomotor development) and progressive cerebral and
      cerebellar atrophy with affected individuals becoming progressively non-reactive
      to environmental stimuli.
