    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia with multiple joint dislocations characterized
      by stunted stature articular hypermobility and spinal malalignment resulting
      in severe progressive kyphosis. Joint dislocations include bilateral dislocation
      of the radial heads with elbow contractures feet (bilateral talipes equinovarus)
      and congenital dislocations of the hip and genu valgus. Joint laxity is particularly
      observed in fingers. Spinal changes include moderate platyspondyly with anterior
      projection of the vertebral bodies. Facial features of oval face with a flattened
      nasal bridge button nose long upper lip prominent eyes and blue sclera are characteristic
      but variable. Patients may also present mild skin extensibility spatulate terminal
      phalanges lip and palate clefts micrognathia and structural cardiac malformations.
