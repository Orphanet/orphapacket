  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome with bone abnormalities characterized
      by onychodystrophy; anomalies of the lower jaw oral vestibule and dentition;
      post-axialpolydactyly; moderately restricted growth with short limbs; and normal
      intelligence. Although it closely resembles Ellis-van Creveld syndrome an allelic
      disorder and another type of ciliopathy WAD is usually a milder disease without
      the presence of heart abnormalities and is inherited in an autosomal dominant
      manner.
