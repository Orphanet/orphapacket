  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome with bone abnormalities characterized
      by onychodystrophy; anomalies of the lower jaw oral vestibule and dentition;
      post-axialpolydactyly; moderately restricted growth with short limbs; and normal
      intelligence. Although it closely resembles Ellis-van Creveld syndrome (see
      this term) an allelic disorder and another type of ciliopathy WAD is usually
      a milder disease without the presence of heart abnormalities and is inherited
      in an autosomal dominant manner.
