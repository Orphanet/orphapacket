  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary cutaneous amyloidosis characterized by macular or reticulate
      hyperpigmentation with symmetrically distributed guttate hypo- and hyperpigmented
      lesions which progress gradually over the years to involve almost the entire
      body (with relative sparing of the face hands feet and neck). Patients are usually
      asymptomatic however mild pruritus may be associated. Amyloid deposition in
      the papillary dermis is observed on skin biopsy. Systemic amyloidosis is not
      present and association with generalized morphea atypical Parkinsonism spasticity
      motor weakness or colon carcinoma is rare.
