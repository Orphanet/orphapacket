  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by global developmental delay or regression variable congenital heart defects
      (such as patent ductus arteriosus atrial or ventricular septal defects and double
      outlet right ventricle among others) and dysmorphic features (including ptosis
      epicanthal folds abnormally set/dysplastic ears low hairline or excess nuchal
      skin wide-spaced/inverted nipples umbilical hernia or diastasis recti and digital
      anomalies). Additional variable manifestations are hyper- or hypotonia seizures
      hearing loss cortical blindness and optic atrophy. Brain imaging may show cerebral
      and cerebellar atrophy and hydrocephalus.
