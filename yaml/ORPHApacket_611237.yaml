  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parkinsonian syndrome due to neurodegenerative disease characterized
      by resting tremor (which may initially be asymmetric) rigidity and bradykinesia.
      Polyneuropathy with neurogenic electromyography findings is present in the majority
      of the patients and reported in young age (early twenties) whereas parkinsonian
      symptoms are visible later in life (between 40 and 70 years of age). Additional
      clinical symptoms may include anxiety and depression. Mild diffuse muscular
      atrophy can also be detected in some patients.
