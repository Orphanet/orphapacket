  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by cerebral
      and portal vein thrombosis portal hypertension macrocephaly and persistent absence
      seizures. Additional reported features include mild to moderate global developmental
      delay and intellectual disability as well as thrombocytopenia. Brain imaging
      may show variable stages of infarction and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.
