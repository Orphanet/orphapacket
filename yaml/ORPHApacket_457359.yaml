  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by overgrowth and macrocephaly with megalencephaly apparent at birth global
      developmental delay intellectual disability and dysmorphic facial features (including
      frontal bossing long face sparse eyebrows hypertelorism downslanting palpebral
      fissures and prognathism). Patients may exhibit tall stature with dolichostenomelia
      arachnodactyly kyphoscoliosis and joint laxity as well as neurologic manifestations
      such as hypotonia gait ataxia or seizures. Brain imaging may show increased
      white matter volume thick corpus callosum or small cerebellum.
