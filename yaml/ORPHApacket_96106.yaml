      from the partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 16 with variable phenotype
      principally characterized by developmental delay severe intellectual disability
      hypotonia facial dysmorphism (incl. high prominent forehead epicanthic folds
      dysplastic ears broad/depressed nasal bridge malar hypoplasia narrow and arched
