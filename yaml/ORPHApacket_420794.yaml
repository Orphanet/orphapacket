  TextSection:
    Contents: Cono-spondylar dysplasia is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia disorder
      characterized by early-onset severe lumbar kyphosis marked brachydactyly and
      irregular pronounced cone epiphyses of the metacarpals and phalanges. Additional
      reported features include developmental delay intellectual disability hypotonia
      epileptic seizures and mild facial dysmorphism (incl. long and thin or square-shaped
      face slight mid-face hypoplasia hypertelorism epicanthic folds low-set ears
      anteverted nostrils). Radiographic findings also reveal hypoplasia of iliac
      wings and anterior defect of vertebral bodies.
