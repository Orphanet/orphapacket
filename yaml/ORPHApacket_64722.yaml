    Contents: A rare gynecologic or obstetric disease characterized by a painful palpable
      breast mass with relative sparing of the subareolar regions often associated
      with inflammation of the overlying skin and accompanied by axillary lymphadenopathy.
      It usually occurs in young parous women with a history of breast-feeding. The
      diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis requires that other granulomatous
      lesions in the breast be excluded.
