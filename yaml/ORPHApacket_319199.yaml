  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 53 (SPG53) is a very rare
      complex type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by early-onset spastic
      paraplegia (with spasticity in the lower extremities that progresses to the
      upper extremities) associated with developmental and motor delay mild to moderate
      cognitive and speech delay skeletal dysmorphism (e.g. kyphosis and pectus) hypertrichosis
      and mildly impaired vibration sense. SPG53 is due to mutations in the <i>VPS37A</i>
      gene (8p22) encoding vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 37A.
