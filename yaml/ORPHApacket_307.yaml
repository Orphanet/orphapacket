    Contents: A rare epilepsy syndrome characterized by adolescence/young adulthood
      onset of myoclonic with or without other generalized seizure types in an otherwise
      healthy individual. The electroencephalogram (EEG) shows 3-5.5&nbsp;Hz generalized
      spike-waves and polyspike-waves. Photosensitivity is common.
