  TextSection:
    Contents: Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is the most common hereditary idiopathic
      generalized epilepsy syndrome and is characterized by myoclonic jerks of the
      upper limbs on awakening generalized tonic-clonic seizures manifesting during
      adolescence and triggered by sleep deprivation alcohol intake and cognitive
      activities and typical absence seizures (30% of cases).
