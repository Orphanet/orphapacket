    Contents: A rare genetic demyelinating hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      disorder characterized by slowly progressive mild to moderate distal muscle
      weakness and atrophy of the upper and lower limbs and variable distal sensory
      impairment associated with variable hyperextensible skin and age-related macular
      degeneration. Hypermobility of distal joints high palate and minor skeletal
      abnormalities (e.g. pectus excavatum dolichocephaly) may also be associated.
