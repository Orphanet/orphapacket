    Contents: A rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized by multiple
      asymptomatic firm well-demarcated nonfollicular hypopigmented or skin-colored
      papules with a diameter of less than 1 cm distributed symmetrically over trunk
      and/or proximal limbs (rarely head neck shoulders armpits thighs) with no extracutaneous
