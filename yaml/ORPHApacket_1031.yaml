  TextSection:
    Contents: A extremely rare genetic malformation syndrome characterized by hypoplastic
      amelogenesis imperfecta (hypoplastic dental enamel) and nephrocalcinosis (precipitation
      of calcium salts in renal tissue). Oral manifestations include yellow and misshaped
      teeth delayed tooth eruption and intrapulpal calcifications. Nephrocalcinosis
      is often asymptomatic but can progress during late childhood or early adulthood
      to impaired renal function recurrent urinary infections renal tubular acidosis
      and rarely to end-stage renal failure.
