  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular tumor characterized by a solitary lesion in the superficial
      or deep soft tissue of the extremities most often originating from a small vein
      as a fusiform intravascular mass also infiltrating surrounding tissues. It is
      composed of epithelioid endothelial cells arranged in short cords and nests
      in a myxohyaline stroma. Patients present with an often painful nodule which
      may be associated with edema or thrombophlebitis. In classic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma
      lacking atypical histological features metastatic rate and mortality are low.
