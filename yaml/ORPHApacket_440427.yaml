    Contents: A rare genetic interstitial lung disease characterized by accumulation
      of lipoproteins in the pulmonary alveoli leading to restrictive lung disease
      and respiratory failure. Patients present with dyspnea tachypnea cough failure
      to thrive and digital clubbing. Liver disease have been described in some cases
      including hepatomegaly steatosis fibrosis or cirrhosis.
