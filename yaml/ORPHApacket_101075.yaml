  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an
      X-linked dominant inheritance pattern and adolescence onset in males of progressive
      distal moderate to severe muscle weakness and atrophy in lower extremities and
      intrinsic hand muscles pes cavus bilateral foot drop reduced or absent tendon
      reflexes as well as mild to moderate sensory impairment in lower extremities.
      Females tend to have milder manifestations or may be asymptomatic. Sensorineural
      deafness and (often transient) central nervous system involvement have also
      been reported.
