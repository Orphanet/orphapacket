  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 is a rare genetic peripheral
      sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern
      and the childhood-onset (within the first decade in males) of progressive distal
      moderate to severe muscle weakness and atrophy in lower extremities and intrinsic
      hand muscles pes cavus bilateral foot drop reduced or absent tendon reflexes
      as well as mild to moderate sensory impairment in lower extremities. Females
      tend to have milder manifestations or may be asymptomatic. Sensorineural deafness
      and central nervous system involvement have also been reported.
