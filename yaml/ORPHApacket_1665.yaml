  TextSection:
    Contents: Sporadic fetal brain disruption sequence is a rare non-syndromic central
      nervous system malformation disorder characterized by severe microcephaly (average
      occipitofrontal circumference -5.8 SD) overlapping sutures keel-like occipital
      bone prominence scalp rugae with normal hair pattern and signs of neurological
      impairment. Brain imaging may show ventriculomegaly cortical tissue deficit
      and hydranencephaly.
