  TextSection:
    Contents: Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma/ganglioglioma are mixed neuronal-glial
      tumors representing a histological spectrum of the same tumor. They are usually
      supratentorially located large cystic masses with a peripheral solid component
      characterized by prominent desmoplastic stroma and pleomorphic populations of
      neoplastic cells with either astrocytic or ganglionic differentiation and poorly
      differentiated cells in variable proportions. They usually present in the first
      18 months of age with rapid head growth bulging anterior fontanel and bone structures
      over the tumor signs of raised intracranial pressure (headache vomiting papilledema)
      focal neurological signs and sometimes seizures.
