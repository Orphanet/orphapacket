  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial isolated arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVC)
      is the familial autosomal dominant form of ARVC (see this term) a heart muscle
      disease characterized by life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias with left
      bundle branch block configuration that may manifest with palpitations ventricular
      tachycardia syncope and sudden fatal attacks and that is due to dystrophy and
      fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium that may lead to
      right ventricular aneurysms.
