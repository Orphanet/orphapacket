  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by normal
      numbers of T and B lymphocytes increased numbers of transitional B cells and
      hypo- to agammaglobulinemia decreased numbers of regulatory T cells and defects
      in T-cell functions due to CARD11 deficiency. It presents with severe susceptibility
      to infections including opportunistic infections.
