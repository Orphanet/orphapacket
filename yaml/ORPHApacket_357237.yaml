  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to CARD11 deficiency is a rare
      combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized by normal numbers of T
      and B lymphocytes increased numbers of transitional B cells and hypo- to agammaglobulinemia
      decreased numbers of regulatory T cells and defects in T-cell functions. It
      presents with severe susceptibility to infections including opportunistic infections.
