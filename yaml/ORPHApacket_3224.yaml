    Contents: Deafness-genital anomalies-metacarpal and metatarsal synostosis syndrome
      is characterised by sensorineural deafness bilateral synostosis of the 4th and
      5th metacarpals and metatarsals genital anomalies (hypospadias in males) psychomotor
      delay and abnormal dermatoglyphics. So far it has been described in two unrelated
