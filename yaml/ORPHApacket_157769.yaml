  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized
      by a partial mirror-image transposition of intra-thoracic and/or intra-abdominal
      organs across the left-right axis of the body. Intra-organ variations and other
      malformations such as ciliary motricity anomalies (e.g. Kartagener syndrome)
      biliary atresia and cardiac defects are frequently associated. Left (polysplenia
      syndrome) or right (asplenia syndrome) isomerism are usually observed.
