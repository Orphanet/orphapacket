  TextSection:
    Contents: Internal carotid artery (ICA) agenesis (uni or bilateral) is a developmental
      defect that may be asymptomatic or lead to cerebrovascular lesions. It is a
      rare malformation with only around hundred cases reported in the literature.
      When symptoms are present they are caused by cerebrovascular insufficiency compression
      of the brain by vessels that dilate to compensate for the absence of the ICA
      or the presence of an aneurysm. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25
      to 35% of patients and are often responsible for intracranial hemorrhage which
      may present as the initial symptom. The absence of the ICA is the result of
      either agenesis or aplasia. The term agenesis is used when both the ICA and
      its bony canal are absent whereas there is some evidence of carotid canals in
      cases of aplasia. The absence of the ICA can be detected by angiography or by
      computerised tomography.
