  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by agenesis (complete absence
      of the carotid canal) aplasia (a remnant of the artery remains) or hypoplastic
      (incomplete embryonic development) of the internal carotid artery which can
      be unilateral or bilateral. Children with the condition are mostly asymptomatic
      due to the presence of collateral circulation. With increasing age the risk
      of cerebrovascular events increases. Patients may present with headache seizures
      or transient ischemic attacks. Cerebral aneurysms may form in the context of
      the condition.
