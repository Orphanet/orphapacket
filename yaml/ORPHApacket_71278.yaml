  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by neonatal onset of severe
      epileptic encephalopathy with brain malformations (including cerebral and cerebellar
      atrophy white matter abnormalities delayed gyration or complete agyria and thin
      corpus callosum) generalized hypotonia and lack of normal development. Additional
      features include facial dysmorphism and necrolytic erythema of the skin. Biochemical
      hallmarks are decreased levels of glutamine in body fluids and chronic hyperammonemia.
      Death may occur in the early post-natal period due to multiple organ failure.
