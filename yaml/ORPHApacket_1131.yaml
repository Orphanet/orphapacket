  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked mandibulofacial dysostosis is an extremely rare multiple congenital
      abnormality syndrome that is characterized by microcephaly malar hypoplasia
      with downslanting palpebral fissures highly arched palate apparently low-set
      and protruding ears micrognathia short stature bilateral hearing loss and learning
      disability. Occasionally additional features have been observed such as bilateral
      cryptorchidism cardiac valvular lesions body asymmetry and pectus excavatum.
