  TextSection:
    Contents: COL4A1-related familial vascular leukoencephalopathy is a rare genetic
      neurological disease characterized by the presence of fragile small-vessel intracerebral
      vasculature in various members of a single family manifesting clinically with
      single or recurrent hemorrhagic and/or ischemic stroke and frequently ocular
      and renal involvement. Neuroimaging reveals diffuse periventricular leukoencephalopathy
      associated with dilated perivascular spaces lacunar infarction and microhemorrhages.
