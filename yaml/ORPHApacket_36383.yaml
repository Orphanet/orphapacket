  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by the presence of
      fragile small-vessel intracerebral vasculature in various members of a single
      family manifesting clinically with single or recurrent hemorrhagic and/or ischemic
      stroke and frequently ocular and renal involvement. Neuroimaging reveals diffuse
      periventricular leukoencephalopathy associated with dilated perivascular spaces
      lacunar infarction and microhemorrhages.
