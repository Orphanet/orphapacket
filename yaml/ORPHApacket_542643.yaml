  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular skin disease characterized by recurrent focal non-inflammatory
      thrombosis of dermal venulae predominantly of the lower extremities resulting
      in a cutaneous response manifested as pruritus and painful papules and erythematous
      plaques. The lesions evolve into hemorrhagic vesicles or bullae which rupture
      and turn into painful ulcers merging into reticulate confluent geometric and
      painful ulcerations. During a period of a few months the ulcerations change
      to porcelain-white atrophic scars with punctate telangiectasia (so-called atrophie
      blanche). In active disease lesions in different stages coexist.
