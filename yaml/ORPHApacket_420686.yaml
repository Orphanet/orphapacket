      epidermal disorder characterized by hypotrichosis/woolly scalp hair sparse body
      hair eyelashes and eyebrows leukonychia and striate palmoplantar keratoderma
      (more severe on the soles than the palms) which progressively worsens with age.

      keratoderma syndrome shares clinical similarities with both Naxos disease and
      Carvajal syndrome cardiomyopathy is notably absent.
