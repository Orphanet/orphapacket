  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare metabolic disorder for which two forms have been described. Lack
      of activity of the erythrocyte isoform of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase
      has been described in subjects with low plasma uric acid levels without obvious
      clinical relevance and will not be described further. Myoadenylate deaminase
      deficiency is an inherited disorder of muscular energy metabolism with a lack
      of AMP deaminase activity in skeletal muscle. It is characterised by exercise-induced
      muscle pain cramps and/or early fatigue.
