    Contents: Verloove Vanhorick-Brubakk syndrome is a multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic
      syndrome characterized by multiple skeletal malformations (short femora and
      humeri bilateral absence of metatarsal and metacarpal bone in hands and feet
      bilateral partial syndactyly of fingers and toes or oligopolysyndactyly deformed
      lumbosacral spine) congenital heart disease (truncus arteriosus) lung and urogenital
      malformations (bilateral bilobar lungs horseshoe kidney cryptorchidism) and
      facial malformations (bilateral cleft lip and palate micrognathia small low-set
      ears without external meatus). It is lethal in the neonatal period. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1981.
