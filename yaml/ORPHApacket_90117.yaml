  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy Okinawa type is a rare genetic
      axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by the adult-onset
      of slowly progressive symmetric proximal dominant muscle weakness and atrophy
      painful muscle cramps fasciculations and distal sensory impairment mostly (but
      not exclusively) in individuals (and their descendents) from the Okinawa region
      in Japan. Absent deep tendon reflexes elevated creatine kinase levels and autosomal
      dominant inheritance are also characteristic.
