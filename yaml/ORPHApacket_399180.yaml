    Contents: A rare osteonecrosis disease characterized by death of bone cellular
      components secondary to an interruption of the subchondral blood supply typically
      manifesting with unilateral or bilateral unifocal or multifocal lesions usually
      located on the epiphysis metaphysis and/or diaphysis of the femoral heads knees
      shoulders ankles and/or wrists leading to gradual onset of pain and progressive
      joint degeneration resulting in loss of function. Association with corticosteroid

      and/or underlying autoimmune or metabolic disease amongst others has been observed.
