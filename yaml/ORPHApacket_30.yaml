  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder of pyrimidine metabolism characterized by early
      onset of megaloblastic anemia global developmental delay and failure to thrive
      associated with massive urinary overexcretion of orotic acid (sometimes with
      orotic acid crystalluria). Patients without megaloblastic anemia but with additional
      manifestations such as epilepsy have also been reported.
