  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by either late-onset myopathy with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and
      muscular weakness (predominantly limb-girdle) or early-onset myopathy presenting
      with decreased fetal movements congenital ptosis progressive external ophthalmoplegia
      hypotonia and variably joint contractures. Reduced content and multiple deletions
      of mitochondrial DNA is observed in muscle biopsy.
