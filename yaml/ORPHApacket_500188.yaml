    Contents: A rare syndromic genetic deafness characterized by congenital hearing
      loss atresia or stenosis of the external auditory canal dilated internal auditory
      canal malformation of the inner ear (incomplete separation of the cochlea basal
      turn from the fundus of the internal auditory canal) in combination with abnormal
      auricular shape and facial dysmorphism (including thick eyebrows ptosis broad
      nasal root and telecanthus). Intelligence is normal and developmental delay
