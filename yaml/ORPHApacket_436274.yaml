  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized by yellowish
      skin papules (resembling pseudoxanthoma elasticum) located on the neck chest
      and/or flexural areas associated with loose redundant sagging skin on trunk
      and upper limbs and retinitis pigmentosa in the absence of clotting abnormalities.
      Patients present reduced night and peripheral vision as well as optic nerve
      pallor retinal pigment epithelium loss attenuated retinal vessels and/or black
      pigment intra-retinal clumps.
