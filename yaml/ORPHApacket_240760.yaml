    Contents: Nijmegen breakage syndrome-like disorder is a rare genetic multiple
      congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by growth retardation
      short stature developmental delay intellectual disability craniofacial dysmorphism
      (i.e. severe microcephaly sloping forehead prominent eyes broad nasal ridge
      hypoplastic nasal septum epicanthal folds) spontaneous chromosomal instability
      cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and radioresistant DNA synthesis
      without severe infections immunodeficiency or cancer predisposition. Additional
      reported features include mild spasticity slight and nonprogressive ataxia hyperopia
      multiple pigmented nevi widely spaced nipples and clinodactyly.
