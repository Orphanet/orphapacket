      (i.e. severe microcephaly sloping forehead prominent eyes broad nasal ridge
      hypoplastic nasal septum epicanthal folds) spontaneous chromosomal instability
      cellular hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and radioresistant DNA synthesis
      without severe infections immunodeficiency or cancer predisposition. Additional
