  TextSection:
    Contents: Tibial hemimelia-polysyndactyly-triphalangeal thumb syndrome is a rare
      genetic dysostosis syndrome with marked inter- and intra-familial variation
      typically characterized by triphalangeal thumbs hand and/or foot polysyndactyly
      and/or absent/hypoplastic tibiae (associated with duplication of fibulae in
      some cases) although isolated triphalangeal thumbs have also been reported.
      It is often accompanied with remarkable short stature and additional features
      may include radio-ulnar synostosis and hand oligodactyly as well as abnormal
      carpal and metatarsal bones.
