    Contents: Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis is a rare epilepsy
      syndrome defined by seizures originating in limbic areas of the mesial temporal
      lobe particularly in the hippocampus amygdala and in the parahippocampal gyrus
      and its connections and hippocampal sclerosis usually unilateral or assymetric.
      It is frequently associated with an initial precipitating event such as febrile
      seizures hypoxia intracranial infection or head trauma most often occurring
      in the first five years of life followed by a latent period without seizures.
      Typical seizures consist of a characteristic aura that is frequently a rising
      epigastric sensation associated with emotional disturbances illusions and autonomic
      symptoms (widened pupils palpitations) progressive impairment of consciousness
      oro-alimentary automatisms (lip smacking chewing licking tooth grinding) behavioral
      arrest head deviation dystonic postures hand and verbal automatisms. Seizures
      are followed by postictal dysfunction. Initially seizures are easily controlled
      with antiepileptic drugs later they frequently become refractory and associated
      with progressive behavioral changes and memory deficits.
