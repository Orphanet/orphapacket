  TextSection:
    Contents: Coloboma of macula is a rare non-syndromic developmental defect of the
      eye characterized by well-circumscribed oval or rounded usually unilateral atrophic
      lesions of varying size presenting rudimentary or absent retina choroid and
      sclera located at the macula leading to decreased vision and on occasion other
      symptoms (e.g. strabismus). It is usually isolated but may also be associated
      with Down syndrome skeletal or renal disorders.
