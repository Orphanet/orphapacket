  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia with severe proximal femoral dysplasia
      is a rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by severe early-onset dysplasia
      of the proximal femurs with almost complete absence of the secondary ossification
      centers and abnormal development of the femoral necks (short and broad with
      irregular metaphyses). It is associated with gait abnormality mild short stature
      arthralgia joint stiffness with limited mobility of the hips and irregular acetabula
      and hip and knee pain. Coxa vara and mild spinal changes are also associated.
