    Contents: A rare genetic neuro-ophthalmological disease characterized by progressive
      weakness of the external eye muscles resulting in bilateral ptosis and diffuse
      symmetric ophthalmoparesis. Additional signs may include skeletal muscle weakness
      cataracts hearing loss sensory axonal neuropathy ataxia parkinsonism cardiomyopathy
      hypogonadism and depression. It is usually less severe than autosomal recessive
      form.
