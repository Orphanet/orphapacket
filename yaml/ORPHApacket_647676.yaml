    Contents: A rare multiple epiphyseal dysplasia characterized by mild short stature
      joint pain and early-onset osteoarthropathy frequently requiring joint replacement.
      Radiographs from affected individuals may manifest features typical of Desbuquois
      dysplasia including irregularly shaped capital femoral epiphyses a short femoral
      neck (resembles the ''Swedish key'' appearance of the proximal femur) and advanced
      carpal ossification in the hands. However some other features typical of Desbuquois
      dysplasia like joint dislocations scoliosis coronal clefts or other hand anomalies
      including accessory ossification centers and/or delta phalanx are not observed.
      Anterior wedging of vertebral bodies small epiphyses at the knees with metaphyseal
      flare may be present. Patients have normal metacarpal and phalangeal lengths
      no distinctive facies nor neurologic complications.
