  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by a variable phenotype comprising
      delayed psychomotor development or neurodevelopmental regression hypotonia seizures
      microcephaly optic atrophy pyramidal signs and peripheral neuropathy among others.
      Age of onset and disease severity are also variable with some cases taking a
      fatal course in early infancy. Serum lactate levels may be elevated. Reported
      brain imaging findings include abnormal signals in the basal ganglia cerebral
      and/or cerebellar atrophy and white matter abnormalities.
