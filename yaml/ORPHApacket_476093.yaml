  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by length-dependent
      axonal motor neuropathy predominantly affecting the lower limbs in combination
      with a myopathy with morphological features of myofibrillar myopathy with aggregates
      and rimmed vacuoles. Age of onset is typically in the second to third decade
      of life. Patients present with slowly progressive muscle weakness and atrophy
      initially affecting the distal lower limbs and later progressing to involve
      proximal limbs and also truncal muscles. There is no involvement of respiratory
      and cardiac muscles.
