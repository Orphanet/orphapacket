  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by acute reversible and
      sometimes recurrent neurologic deterioration (including drowsiness hypotonia
      dysarthria and ataxia) during a febrile illness. The condition is associated
      with reversible leukoencephalopathy and persistently increased urinary excretion
      (and sometimes cerebrospinal fluid concentration) mainly of alpha-ketoglutarate
      and N-acetylaspartate.
