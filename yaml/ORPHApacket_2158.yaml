  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of histidine metabolism characterized by histidinuria
      without histidinemia due to impaired intestinal and renal tubular absorption
      of histidine. Developmental delay intellectual disability seizures and mild
      dysmorphic features have been reported in association. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1992.
