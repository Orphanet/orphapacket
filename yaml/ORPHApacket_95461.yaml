  TextSection:
    Contents: Straddling or overriding tricuspid valve is a rare congenital tricuspid
      valve malformation characterized by the tricuspid valve that overrides the ventricular
      septum and communicates with both ventricles as part of the tension apparatus
      of the valve crosses the ventricular septal defect and is attached in the left
      ventricle. The anomaly occurs with other congenital heart defects (transposition
      of great vessels left ventricle outflow tract obstruction double outlet right
      ventricle hypoplastic right ventricle) which determine the main clinical manifestation.
