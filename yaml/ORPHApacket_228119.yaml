  TextSection:
    Contents: Fusariosis describes a superficial locally invasive disseminated infection
      with the pathogenic fungus species <i>Fusarium</i> often found in soil and water
      which is mainly transmitted to humans through traumatic inoculation and that
      manifests with keratitis onychomycosis and less frequently peritonitis and cellulitis.
      In the immunocompromised disseminated fusariosis is more common and it manifests
      with refractory fever skin lesions (ecthyma-like target and multiple subcutaneous
      nodules) severe myalgias and sino-pulmonary infections.
