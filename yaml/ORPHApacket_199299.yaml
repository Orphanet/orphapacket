  TextSection:
    Contents: Late-onset isolated ACTH deficiency is a rare acquired pituitary hormone
      deficiency characterized by secondary adrenal insufficiency with normal secretion
      of anterior pituitary hormones except for ACTH. Patients present with weakness
      fatigue weight loss anorexia vomiting/nausea hypoglycemia and abnormally low
