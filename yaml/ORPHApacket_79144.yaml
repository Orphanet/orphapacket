    Contents: A rare isolated nail anomaly characterized by congenital unilateral
      or bilateral nail dysplasia (including micronychia polyonychia anonychia hemionychrogryphosis
      and malalignment) commonly involving the index fingers and/or other fingers
      or also toes frequently associated with bony anomalies of the affected digits
      (such as Y-shaped bifurcation of the distal phalanx brachymesophalangy or syndactyly).
      The condition can be sporadic or familial.
