  TextSection:
    Contents: An amino acid disorder with neonatal onset that is clinically characterized
      by the classic manifestations of phenylketonuria (PKA) and that later on is
      clinically differentiated by neurologic symptoms such as microcephaly intellectual
      disability central hypotonia delayed motor development peripheral spasticity
      and seizures that develop and persist despite an established metabolic control
      of plasma phenylalanine.
