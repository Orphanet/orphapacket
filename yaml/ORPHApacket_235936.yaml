    Contents: 'Familial hyperaldosteronism (FH) is the heritable form of primary aldosteronism
      (PA) which comprises three identified subtypes to date: FH type I (FH-I; see
      this term) characterized by early-onset hypertension glucocorticoid remediable
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent hyperaldosteronism variable hypokalemia
      and overproduction of 18-oxocortisol and 18-hydroxycortisol; FH type II (FH-II;
      see this term) characterized by hypertension of varying severity and hyperaldosteronism
      not suppressible by dexamethasone; and FH type III (FH-III; see this term) characterized
      by profound hypokalemia early-onset severe hypertension non glucocorticoid-remediable
      hyperaldosteronism and overproduction of 18-oxocortisol and 18-hydroxycortisol.'
