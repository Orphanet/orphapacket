    Contents: Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 1 is a rare acquired eye disease
      characterized by unilateral (rarely bilateral) abnormally dilated and tortuous
      capillaries around the fovea associated with multiple arteriolar and venular
      aneurysms lipid depositions and intra-retinal cystoid degeneration. It leads
      to vision loss due to macular edema with hard exudates.
