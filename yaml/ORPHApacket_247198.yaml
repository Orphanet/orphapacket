  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by postnatal onset
      of severe global developmental delay profound mental retardation progressive
      microcephaly progressive spasticity evolving into spastic quadriplegia with
      joint contractures generalized seizures and irritability. Severe choreoathetosis
      and dysmorphic features are absent. Brain imaging shows progressive cerebellar
      atrophy followed by cerebral atrophy affecting both white and grey matter but
      no pontine involvement.
