  TextSection:
    Contents: Ravine syndrome is an extremely rare genetic neurological disorder reported
      in a small number of patients in a specific community on Reunion Island (Ravine
      region) characterized by infantile anorexia with irrepressible and repeated
      vomiting acute brainstem dysfunction severe failure to thrive and progressive
      encephalopathy with MRI showing vanishing of medulla oblongata and cerebellar
      white matter and severe atrophy of pons along with supra-tentorial periventricular
      white-matter hyperintensities and basal ganglia anomalies.
