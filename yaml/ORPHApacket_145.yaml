  TextSection:
    Contents: A genetic condition characterized by hereditary susceptibility to breast
      and/or ovarian cancer. It can be defined using family history criteria or through
      identification of germline pathogenic variants (GPVs) in clinically validated
      HBOC genes. However the genetic basis of about half of clinical HBOC is currently
      unknown or unexplained by single-gene variants and approximately half of individuals
      who harbour PVs in HBOC genes do not have a suggestive family history.
