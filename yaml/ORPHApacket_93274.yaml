  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of thanatophoric dysplasia characterized by prenatal onset of
      micromelia with straight femurs platyspondyly narrow thorax and cloverleaf skull
      with increased risk of hydrocephalus and neurological complications. Fetal MRI
      can identify temporal lobe abnormalities and a narrow foramen magnum. Postnatally
      distinctive facial features include macrocephaly frontal bossing midface hypoplasia
      low nasal bridge large anterior fontanel and proptosis. Neonates usually die
      shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency and/or spinal cord/brain
      stem compression.
