  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare renal diseases characterized by amyloid fibril deposition
      of apolipoprotein A-I or A-II (AApoAI or AApoAII amyloidosis) lysozyme (ALys
      amyloidosis) or fibrinogen A-alpha chain (AFib amyloidosis) in one or several
      organs. Renal involvement leading to chronic renal disease and renal failure
      is a common sign. Additional manifestations depend on the organ involved and
      the type of amyloid fibrils deposited.
