  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary interstitial lung disease characterized by the accumulation
      of lipids and proteins related to surfactant in the alveoli in association with
      the presence of antibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
      factor (GM-CSF). The disease leads to a progressive impairment of gas exchange
      and respiratory insufficiency.
