  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant form of heart-hand syndrome that is characterized
      by adult onset progressive cardiac conduction disease tachyarrhythmias that
      can lead to sudden death dilated cardiomyopathy and brachydactyly with the hands
      less severely affected than the feet. Muscle weakness and/or myopathic electromyographic
      findings have been observed in some cases.
