  TextSection:
    Contents: Pineoblastoma is a rare malignant type of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal
      tumor (sPNET) found mainly in children (less than 10% of cases are reported
      in adults) and located in the pineal region of the brain but that can metastasize
      along the neuroaxis. As it is the most aggressive of the pineal parenchymal
      tumors it is usually associated with a poor prognosis.
