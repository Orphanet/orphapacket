  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by shortening (hypoplasia
      or aplasia) of the middle phalanges of the index finger and sometimes of the
      fifth finger. On radiographs the middle phalanx of the index fingers often appear
      triangular and in severely affected cases the index finger is curved radially.
      The lower limb phenotype is generally milder.
