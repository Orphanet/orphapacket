  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic chronic recurrent slowly progressive epidermal disease
      characterized by small sterile pustular eruptions involving the nails and surrounding
      skin of the fingers and/or toes which coalesce and burst leaving erythematous
      atrophic skin where new pustules develop. Onychodystrophy is frequently associated
      and anonychia and osteolysis are reported in severe cases. Local expansion (to
      involve the hands forearms and/or feet) and involvement of mucosal surfaces
      (e.g. conjunctiva tongue urethra) may be observed.
