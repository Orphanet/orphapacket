  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 7 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      a variable phenotype that includes onset in infancy or early childhood of failure
      to thrive and psychomotor regression (after initial normal development) as well
      as ocular manifestations (such as ptosis nystagmus optic atrophy ophthalmoplegia
      and reduced vision). Additional manifestations include bulbar paresis with facial
      weakness hypotonia difficulty chewing dysphagia mild dysarthria ataxia global
      muscle atrophy and areflexia. It has a relatively slow disease progression with
      patients often living into the third decade of life.
