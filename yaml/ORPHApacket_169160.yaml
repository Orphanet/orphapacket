  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare T-B+ severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by a T cell-negative
      B cell-positive natural killer (NK) cell-positive immune phenotype. Patients
      present in infancy or early childhood with recurrent infections. Clinical manifestations
      may vary in severity depending on the underlying molecular defect resulting
      in early death without bone marrow transplantation in some patients.
