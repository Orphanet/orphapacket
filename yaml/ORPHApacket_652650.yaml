  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by generalized lymphadenopathy
      and predominantly follicular or perifollicular growth pattern consistent with
      the expression of T-follicular helper markers. Affected individuals distinctly
      lack histologic features (such as proliferation of high endothelial venules
      and expanded follicular dendritic meshworks) typically associated to angioimmunoblastic
      T-cell lymphoma. It affects elderly individuals (mostly at the sixth decade
      of life) that present with advanced-stage disease. Majority of the cases have
      disseminated nodal involvement whereas involvement of extranodal sites including
      skin liver spleen and bone marrow are also reported. Patients may therefore
      develop skin rash and immune manifestations.
