  TextSection:
    Contents: A heterogenous group of rare endocrine diseases characterized by a generalized
      or localized loss of adipose tissue (lipoatropy) associated with dysmetabolic
      alterations with insulin resistance altered glucose tolerance or diabetes and
      hypertriglyceridemia leading to a risk of acute pancreatitis. The diabetes leads
      to chronic complications involving the retina kidney nerves and cardiovascular
      system and to liver steatosis that could result in cirrhosis. In some forms
      lipoatrophy is associated with selective hypertrophy of other fat deposits.
      Clinical signs of insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans and signs of hyperandrogenism)
      are often present. It has both genetic and acquired forms.
