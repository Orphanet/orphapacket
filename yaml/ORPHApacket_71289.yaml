  TextSection:
    Contents: Radio-ulnar synostosis-amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia syndrome is
      characterised by the association of proximal fusion of the radius and ulna with
      congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopaenia. Less than 10 cases have been reported
      in the literature so far. The syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant
      trait and is caused by mutations in the <i>HOXA11</i> gene (7p15).
