  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by all the characteristics
      of sickle cell anemia (SCA). Clinical course is similar to SCA including acute
      episodes of pain splenic infarction and splenic sequestration crisis vaso-occlusive
      crisis acute chest syndrome ischemic brain injury osteomyelitis and avascular
      bone necrosis. The genotype is characterized by an HbS allele in combination
      with the HbD variant beta121Glu>Gln.
