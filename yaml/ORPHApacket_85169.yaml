  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial digital arthropathy-brachydactyly is characterised by the association
      of arthropathy of interphalangeal metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal
      joints with brachydactyly of the middle and distal phalanges. It has been described
      in numerous members from five generations of one large family. Inheritance is
      autosomal dominant.
