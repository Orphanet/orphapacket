  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia with increased bone density characterized
      by craniofacial dysostosis with a small cranium and thin skull bone depressions
      over the frontoparietal and occipitoparietal sutures marked hypoplasia of mandible
      exophthalmos cortical sclerosis of the long bones and normal intelligence. The
      long bones are short and bent and thickening of bone cortex occurs during the
      pubertal and post-pubertal periods and increases with age. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1995.
