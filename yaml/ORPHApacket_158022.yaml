  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive nodular histiocytosis is a rare normolipemic non-Langerhans
      cell histiocytosis characterized by progressive growth of multiple to disseminated
      asymptomatic skin lesions that range in appearance from yellow plaques to coalescence-prone
      red-brown papules nodules and pedunculated tumors up to 5 cm in size located
      typically on the face trunk and extremities (and rarely on conjuctiva and mucous
      membranes). Characteristic microscopic findings include a storiform spindle
      cell infiltrate in the deep dermis with xanthomatized macrophages and some Touton
      cells in the upper dermis. It is usually not associated with systemic disease.
