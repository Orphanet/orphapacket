    Contents: A rare type of familial hypoaldosteronism characterized by early infantile
      onset of vomiting diarrhea severe dehydration and failure to thrive. Analysis
      of plasma electrolytes shows hyponatremia hyperkalemia and acidosis. Plasma
      renin activity is elevated and aldosterone levels are low.
