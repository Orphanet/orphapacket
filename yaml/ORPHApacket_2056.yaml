  TextSection:
    Contents: Essential fructosuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of fructose
      metabolism (see this term) caused by a deficiency of fructokinaseenzyme activity.
      It is characterized by elevated fructosemia and presence of fructosuria following
      ingestion of fructose and related sugars (sucrose sorbitol). Essential fructosuria
      is clinically asymptomatic and harmless. Dietary restriction is not indicated.
