  TextSection:
    Contents: Essential fructosuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of fructose
      metabolism caused by a deficiency of fructokinaseenzyme activity. It is characterized
      by elevated fructosemia and presence of fructosuria following ingestion of fructose
      and related sugars (sucrose sorbitol). Essential fructosuria is clinically asymptomatic
      and harmless. Dietary restriction is not indicated.
