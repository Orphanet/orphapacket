  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemorrhagic disorder characterized by easy bruising (without
      hemarthrosis or spontaneous hematomas) epistaxis bleeding gums and excessive
      bleeding after minor trauma or surgical procedures. Severity of bleeding is
      variable and blood transfusion may be required. Affected females may have menorrhagia.
      Patients present with a prolonged prothrombin time and/or activated partial
      thromboplastin time normal levels of all coagulation factors normal protein&nbsp;C
      activity and elevated tissue factor pathway inhibitor levels. It is caused by
      different mutations in factor&nbsp;V (<i>FV</i>) gene leading to short isoforms
      of the FV protein. Point mutation at A2440G is known as East Texas beeding disorder
      point mutation at C2588G is known as Amsterdam bleeding disorder and a large
      deletion in F5 exon&nbsp;13 is known as Atlanta bleeding disorder.
