    Contents: A rare inherited cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by occurrence
      of multiple synchronous primary carcinoids of the small intestine. Clinical
      presentation is otherwise indistinguishable from sporadic carcinoids and includes
      abdominal pain flushing and diarrhea often becoming manifest only after a long
      asymptomatic period. Most patients present with low grade tumors. Occurrence
      of pulmonary carcinoids has also been reported.
