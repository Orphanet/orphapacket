    Contents: A rare genetic autoinflammatory syndrome with skin involvement characterized
      by cold-induced urticarial rash without angioedema starting in infancy and systemic
      inflammation due to autosomal dominant mutations in the coagulation factor&nbsp;(12&nbsp;(F-12)&nbsp;gene.
      In addition to cold-induced non-pruritic urticarial rash patients present with
      headache mild to severe arthralgia fatigue subfebrile evening temperature chills
