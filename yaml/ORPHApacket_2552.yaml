  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease characterized by chronic diarrhea leading to
      severe weight loss caused by microsporidia contamination (most commonly by Encephalitozoon
      or Enterocytozoon). Contamination can occur through ingesting spores present
      in water or food or via direct human-to-human contact. Immunodeficient patients
      (such as individuals with HIV and patients who have undergone a bone marrow
      or organ transplant) may be severely affected. These protozoan parasites mainly
      develop in intestinal cells but can also be found in adipocytes epithelial cells
      and blood cells.
