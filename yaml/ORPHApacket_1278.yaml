    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized the association of
      hallux varus with short thumbs and first toes (involving the metacarpals metatarsals
      and distal phalanges; the proximal and middle phalanges are of normal length)
      and abduction of the affected digits. Intellectual deficit was observed in all
      reported individuals. There have been no further reports since 1994.
