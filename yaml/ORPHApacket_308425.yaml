  TextSection:
    Contents: Methylmalonic acidemia due to methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency
      is a rare inborn error of metabolism disease characterized by mild to moderate
      persistent elevation of methylmalonic acid in plasma urine and cerebrospinal
      fluid. Clinical presentation may include acute metabolic decompensation with
      metabolic acidosis (presenting with vomiting dehydration confusion hallucinations)
      nonspecific neurological symptoms or may also be asymptomatic.
