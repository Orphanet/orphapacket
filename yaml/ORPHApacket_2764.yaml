  TextSection:
    Contents: Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is a rare bone disease characterized
      by an acquired idiopathic necrotic lesion of subchondral bone with the formation
      of a sequestrum which may detach to form loose bodies in joints. OCD mainly
      affects the knee ankle and elbow joints and can lead to pain functional limitations
      and secondary osteoarthritis.
