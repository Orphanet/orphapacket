  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare isolated congenital head and neck morphological anomaly characterized
      by the unilateral hypoplasia/agenesis of the depressor anguli oris muscle resulting
      in an asymmetric crying facies in neonatal period/infancy (drooping of one corner
      of the mouth during crying) while eye closure nasolabial fold and forehead wrinkling
      are symmetric. Although isolated in the majority of cases newborns presenting
      with this morphological anomaly should be referred for further screening for
      22q11.2 deletion syndrome and/or other coexisting cardiovascular musculoskeletal
      cervicofacial respiratory genitourinary and endocrine anomalies.
