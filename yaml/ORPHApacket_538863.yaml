  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by rapidly
      progressive single or multiple painful aseptic ulcers which present overhanging
      violaceous and undermined borders surrounding induration and erythema and granulation
      tissue (occasionally necrotic tissue and/or a purulent exudate) at the base
      mainly affecting the legs (but other body surfaces may also be involved) leading
      to chronic ulcerations and often regressing with cribriform mutilating scars.
      The disease presents a chronic relapsing course and systemic features (e.g.
      fever malaise arthralgia myalgia) may be associated.
