  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare genetic congenital malformation syndrome characterized by bilateral
      anopthalmia (or less commonly microphthalmia) in association with a variable
      combination of the following: pulmonary hypoplasia or agenesis congenital diaphragmatic
      hernia or eventration and variable cardiovascular defects (congenital heart
      defects and/or pulmonary artery atresia). Intellectual disability is noted in
      surviving patients. Other variable malformations affecting different organ systems
      as well as facial dysmorphism may be observed.'
