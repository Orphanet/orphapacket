  TextSection:
    Contents: Craniometadiaphyseal dysplasia wormian bone type is an extremely rare
      craniotubular bone dysplasia syndrome described in fewer than 10 patients to
      date. Clinical manifestations include macrocephaly frontal bossing malar hypoplasia
      prominent mandible and dental hypoplasia. Other skeletal anomalies include abnormal
      bone modeling in tubular bones multiple wormian bones and deformities of chest
      pelvis and elbows. An increased risk of fractures is noted.
