  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary angioedema characterized by normal serum levels and
      function of C1 inhibitor normal C1 activity and clinically recurrent subcutaneous
      edema abdominal pain attacks and episodes of potentially life-threatening upper
      airway obstruction. The disorder occurs almost exclusively in women and episodes
      are often precipitated or worsened by high estrogen levels (such as during pregnancy
