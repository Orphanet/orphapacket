  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mycosis caused by ubiquitous opportunistic fungi of the order
      Mucorales characterized by tissue infarction and necrosis due to invasion of
      the vasculature by hyphae. The spectrum of clinical manifestations depends on
      the route of infection and includes rhinocerebral pulmonary cutaneous gastrointestinal
      renal and disseminated forms. The disease is usually rapidly progressive and
      associated with high mortality.
