  TextSection:
    Contents: An extended form of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis
      spectrum characterized by destruction and detachment of the skin epithelium
      involving 30% or more of the body surface area and mucous membranes. Onset usually
      occurs 4-28 days after administration of the causal medication and is most frequently
      associated with anticonvulsants antibacterial sulfonamides allopurinol nevirapine
      and oxicams (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) but many other medications
      have also been implicated. The disease is not induced by medication in 15% of
      cases. Histology is characterized by an epidermal necrolysis. Multiple disabling
      long-term sequelae (especially cutaneous ocular and psychological) are frequent.
