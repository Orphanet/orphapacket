  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital malformation characterized by the absence of calvarial
      bones dura mater and associated muscles while skull base facial bones and brain
      structures are normal. Central nervous system is usually unaffected however
      some neuropathological abnormalities such as holoprosencephaly hydrocephalus
      micropolygyria and gyration anomalies can be present. Prenatal diagnosis by
      ultrasonography is usually confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging as it can
      be confused with anencephaly or encephalocele.
