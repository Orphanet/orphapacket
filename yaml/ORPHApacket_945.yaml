  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malformation characterized by missing scalp and flat bones over
      an area of the cranial vault. The size of the affected area is variable. In
      rare cases acalvaria involves the whole of the dome-like superior portion of
      the cranium comprising the frontal parietal and occipital bones. Dura mater
      and associated muscles are absent in the affected area but the central nervous
      system is usually unaffected although some neuropathological abnormality is
      often present (<i>e.g.</i> holoprosencephaly or gyration anomalies). Skull base
      and facial bones are normal.
