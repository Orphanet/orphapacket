  TextSection:
    Contents: Mazabraud syndrome is a rare primary bone dysplasia (see this term)
      characterized by the association of fibrous dysplasia with intramuscular myxomas.
      Fibrous dysplasia (usually polyostotic sometimes monostotic) occurs during the
      growth period and can be asymptomatic or can present with pain skeletal deformities
      or fractures while intramuscular myxoma associated with polyostotic fibrous
      dysplasia (see this term) is usually multifocal typically occuring in the vicinity
      of skeletal lesions and presents in adulthood as a painless soft-tissue mass
      (most commonly in the thigh). Although it is a benign condition local recurrences
      of myxomas after incomplete excision and malignant transformation of a fibrous
      dysplastic lesion into osteogenic sarcoma have been reported.
