  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic distal myopathy disorder characterized by middle age-onset
      of distal leg muscle weakness atrophy in the anterior compartment resulting
      in foot drop without proximal or scapular skeletal muscle weakness. Rapidly
      progressive dementia Paget disease of bone and hand weakness have been reported.
      Muscle biopsy shows pronounced myopathic changes with rimmed vacuoles.
