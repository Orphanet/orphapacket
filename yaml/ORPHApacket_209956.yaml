  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare panuveitis characterized by uni- or bilateral abnormal fluid
      accumulation within the suprachoroidal space resulting in internal choroidal
      elevation in the absence of any known cause such as decreased intraocular tension
      intraocular tumor intraocular inflammation or nanophtalmos. Patients typically
      present a protracted relapsing-remitting course of visual acuity loss and fundus
      examination shows annular celio-choroidal detachment and shifting serous retinal
      detachment.
