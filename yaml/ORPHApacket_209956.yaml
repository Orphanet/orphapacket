  TextSection:
    Contents: Idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome is a rare acquired eye disease characterized
      by uni- or bilateral abnormal fluid accumulation within the suprachoroidal space
      resulting in internal choroidal elevation in the absence of any known cause
      such as decreased intraocular tension intraocular tumor intraocular inflammation
      or nanophtalmos. Patients typically present a protracted relapsing-remitting
      course of visual acuity loss and fundus examination shows annular celio-choroidal
      detachment and shifting serous retinal detachment.
