    Contents: Congenital muscular dystrophy with cerebellar involvement is a rare
      congenital muscular dystrophy due to dystroglycanopathy characterized by proximal
      muscule weakness with a tendency for muscle hypertrophy and pseudohypertrophy
      variable cognitive impairment microcephaly cerebellar hypoplasia with or without
      cysts and other structural brain anomalies.
