  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature due to GHSR deficiency is a rare genetic endocrine growth
      disease resulting from growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) deficiency
      characterized by postnatal growth delay that results in short stature (less
      than -2 SD). The pituitary gland is typically without morphological changes
      although anterior pituitary gland hypoplasia has been reported.
