  TextSection:
    Contents: Maternal riboflavin deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of metabolite
      absorption or transport characterized by persistently decreased riboflavin serum
      levels due to a primary genetic defect in the mother and which leads to clinical
      and biochemical findings consistent with a secondary life-threatening transient
      multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) in the newborn. The mother
      usually presents hyperemesis gravidarum in the absence of other features of
      riboflavin deficiency such as skin lesions jaundice pruritus sore mucous membranes
      visual disturbances.
