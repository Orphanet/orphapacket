  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hematologic disease characterized by symptoms of mast cell activation
      in the absence of cutaneous findings as well as absence of diagnostic criteria
      of systemic mastocytosis with tryptase levels of less than 20 ng/ml and normal
      to low burden of mast cells. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the presence of monoclonal
      mast cells carrying the KIT D816V mutation and/or expressing CD25. Patients
      present with recurrent episodes of flushing headache hypotension abdominal cramping
      nausea diarrhea cardiac arrhythmias bronchoconstriction and bleeding diathesis
