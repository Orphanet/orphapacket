      in the absence of cutaneous findings as well as absence of diagnostic criteria
      of systemic mastocytosis with tryptase levels of less than 20 ng/ml and normal
      to low burden of mast cells. Bone marrow biopsy reveals the presence of monoclonal
      mast cells carrying the <i>KIT</i> D816V mutation and/or expressing CD25. Patients
