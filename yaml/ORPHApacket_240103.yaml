  TextSection:
    Contents: An atypical variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) a rare late-onset
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by a variable mixture of progressive
      asymmetric limb rigidity apraxia cortical sensory loss alien limb dystonia and
      bradykinesia that is unresponsive to levodopa. Postural instability and axial
      rigidity develop as the disease progresses. Neuropathological characteristics
      includes tau pathology and neuronal loss in specific brain areas especially
      in the midfrontal and inferior parietal cortices.
