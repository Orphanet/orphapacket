  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital isolated hyperinsulinism disorder characterized by
      neonatal presentation of severe refractory hypoglycemia in the first two days
      of life with limited response to medical management sometimes requiring pancreatic
      resection. Newborns are often large for gestational age with mild to moderate
      hepatomegaly and diffuse form of hyperinsulinism due to Kir6.2 deficiency. Persistent
      hypoglycemia hyperglycemia and type1 diabetes mellitus may develop later in
      life. Life-threatening hypoglycemic coma or status epilepticus have also been
      associated.
