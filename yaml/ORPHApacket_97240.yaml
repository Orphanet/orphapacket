  TextSection:
    Contents: Zebra body myopathy is a benign congenital myopathy characterised by
      congenital hypotonia and weakness. Prevalence is unknown. Less than ten patients
      have been described so far. Muscle biopsy shows zebra bodies and other myopathic
      changes. Mutations of the <i>alpha-skeletal actin</i> (<i>ACTA1</i>) gene may
      be involved.
