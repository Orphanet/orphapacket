  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital urachal anomaly (CUA) describes a group of urachal remnants
      found more frequently in males than females that result from incomplete closure
      of the urachus (an embryological remnant of the allantois) during prenatal development
      and that are usually asymptomatic (and found as an incidental finding on a radiological
      study) but can also present with umbilical discharge (in patent urachus or urachal
      sinus) infraumblical mass and pain or with complications such as obstruction
      and infection. CUAs include patent urachus urachal sinus urachal cyst and urachal
      diverticulum.
