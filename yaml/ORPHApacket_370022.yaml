    Contents: A rare neuro-ophthalmological disease characterized by nonprogressive
      cerebellar ataxia delayed motor and language development and intellectual disability
      in addition to ophthalmological abnormalities (e.g. oculomotor apraxia strabismus
      amblyopia retinal dystrophy and myopia). Cerebellar cysts cerebellar dysplasia
      and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia seen on magnetic resonance imaging are also
      characteristic of the disease.
