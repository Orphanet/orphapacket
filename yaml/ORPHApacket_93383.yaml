  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by hypoplasia
      or aplasia of the terminal parts of fingers 2 to 5 with complete absence of
      the fingernails. The thumbs are always intact but frequently show flattening
      splitting or duplication of the distal phalanges. Digits on the radial side
      of the hand are less severely affected than those on the ulnar side. The feet
      are similarly affected but less severely. Soft tissue syndactyly symphalangism
      carpal and/or tarsal fusions and shortening of metacarpals and/or metatarsals
      may be present.
