  TextSection:
    Contents: Cleidorhizomelic syndrome is a rhizo-mesomelic dysplasia characterized
      by rhizomelic short stature/dwarfism in combination with lateral clavicular
      defects. Additional manifestations include brachydactyly with bilateral clinodactyly
      and hypoplastic middle phalanx of the fifth digit. X-ray demonstrated an apparent
      Y-shaped or bifid distal clavicle. Cleidorhizomelic syndrome has been reported
      in one family (mother and son) and is suspected to be transmitted in an autosomal
      dominant manner. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1988.
