  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic lymphoproliferative syndrome characterized by early onset
      recurrent infections lymphadenopathy with hepatosplenomegaly and variable autoimmune
      disorders including hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia neutropenia enteropathy
      type I diabetes scleroderma arthritis atopic dermatitis and inflammatory lung
      disease. Patients commonly have failure to thrive. Variable immunologic findings
      include decreased regulatory T-cells hypogammaglobulinemia and reduction in
      memory B cells.
