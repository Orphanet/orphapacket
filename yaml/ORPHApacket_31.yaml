  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic inborn error of metabolism disorder characterized by
      neonatal-onset of developmental delay hypotonia hepatomegaly lactic acidemia
      increased creatine kinase levels elevated alpha-ketoglutaric acid in urine and
      a decreased plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate-to-acetoacetate ratio. Pyruvate dehydrogenase
      deficiency can be associated leading to hypoglycemia and neurologic anomalies
      including seizures.
