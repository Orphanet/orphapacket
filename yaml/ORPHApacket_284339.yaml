  TextSection:
    Contents: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 7 (PCH7) is a novel very rare form of
      pontocerebellar hypoplasia (see this term) with unknown etiology and poor prognosis
      reported in four patients and is characterized clinically during the neonatal
      period by hypotonia no palpable gonads micropenis and from infancy by progressive
      microcephaly apneic episodes poor feeding seizures and regression of penis.
      MRI demonstrates a pontocerebellar hypoplasia. PCH7 is expressed as PCH with
      46,XY disorder of sex development (see this term) in individuals with XY karyotype
      and may be expressed as PCH only in individuals with XX karyotype.
