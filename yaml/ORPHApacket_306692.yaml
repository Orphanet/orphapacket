  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parkinsonian syndrome due to intoxication which develops in individuals
      surviving an acute cyanide intoxication episode or due to chronic exposure to
      small cyanide doses. It presents several weeks after acute exposure with progressive
      typical clinical features of parkinsonism including bradykinesia rigidity dystonia
      hypomimia hypokinetic dysarthria postural instability and retropulsion but no
      resting or postural tremor. Brain MRI reveals bilateral lesions in the pallidum
      posterior putamen substantia nigra subthalamic nucleus temporal and occipital
      cortex and cerebellum.
