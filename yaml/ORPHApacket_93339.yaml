  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic limb malformation characterized by the duplication
      of one or more skeletal components of a biphalangeal thumb and/or hallux. Hands
      are preferentially affected (in bilateral) and the right hand is more commonly
      involved than the left. Hallux duplication may present concomitantly to or independently
      of thumb polydactyly and is predominantly unilateral right.
