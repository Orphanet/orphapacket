  TextSection:
    Contents: Cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital malformative
      communication between the veins and the arteries in the brain in the form of
      a nidus an anatomical structure composed of dilated and tangled supplying arterioles
      and drainage veins with no intervening capillary bed that can be asymptomatic
      or cause depending on the location and the size of the AVM headaches of varying
      severity generalized or focal seizures focalneurological defects (weakness numbness
      speech difficulties vision loss) or potentially fatal intracranial hemorrhage
      in case the AVM ruptures.
