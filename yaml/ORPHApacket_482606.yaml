    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by congenital contractures of the
      distal interphalangeal joints progressive stiffness of the shoulders and neck
      keloid scarring increased optic cup-to-disc ratio and renal stones. Additional
      reported features include arthritis osteoporosis hypoplastic flexion creases
      clinodactyly anxiety and facial dysmorphism (such as sloping forehead prominent
      supraorbital ridges downslanting palpebral fissures prominent ears and high
      arched palate). Female carriers exhibit a variable milder phenotype.
