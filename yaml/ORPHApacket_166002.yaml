  TextSection:
    Contents: Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia due to collagen 9 anomaly is a rare primary
      bone dysplasia disorder characterized by normal or mild short stature early-onset
      pain and/or stiffness of the joints (mainly affecting knees but also elbows
      wrists ankles and fingers with relative sparing of the hips) and early degenerative
      joint disease. Other skeletal anomalies (incl. varus or valgus deformities osteochondritis
      dissecans abnormal carpal shape free articular bodies) and mild myopathy have
      also been reported.
