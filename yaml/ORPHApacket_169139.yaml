    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by a delay in the maturation
      of immunoglobulin production leading to prolongation of the physiologic hypogammaglobulinemia
      of the newborn period beyond six months of age. Patients present recurrent respiratory
      infections otitis media bronchitis gastroenteritis or allergic symptoms in the
      first two to four years of life before the condition resolves spontaneously.
      Some children may remain asymptomatic and severe or life-threatening infections
      are rare. The capacity to synthesize specific antibodies in response to vaccines
      is usually normal.
