  TextSection:
    Contents: Craniotelencephalic dysplasia is an extremely rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis with
      frontal encephalocele and various additional brain anomalies (severe hydrocephalus
      agenesis of the corpus callosum lissencephaly and polymicrogyria parenchymal
      cysts septo-optic dysplasia) resulting in marked cerebral dysfunction seizures
      and very severe psychomotor delay. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1983.
