  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-deafness-intellectual disability syndrome is characterised
      by microcephaly deafness intellectual deficit and facial dysmorphism (facial
      asymmetry prominent glabella low-set and cup-shaped ears protruding lower lip
      micrognathia). It has been described in a mother and her son. The mode of inheritance
      is probably autosomal dominant.
