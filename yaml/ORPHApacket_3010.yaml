  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized
      by non-progressive congenital marked central hypotonia severe psychomotor delay
      and intellectual disability chronic constipation distended abdomen abnormal
      dermatoglyphics delayed and dysharmonic skeletal maturation and preponderance
      of type 2 larger-sized muscle fibers. Additional features include narrow and
      high-arched palate prominent nasal root long philtrum and open mouth with drooling
      as well as variably present cryptorchidism hypertelorism and tapered fingers.
      Seizures and/or an abnormal electroencephalograph may also be assoicated. There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1994.
