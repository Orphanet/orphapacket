  TextSection:
    Contents: Snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration (SVD) is characterised by the presence
      of small granular-like deposits resembling snowflakes in the retina fibrillary
      vitreous degeneration and cataract. The prevalence is unknown but the disorder
      has been described in several families. Transmission is autosomal dominant and
      the causative gene has been localised to a small region on chromosome 2q36.
