    Contents: Progeroid and marfanoid aspect-lipodystrophy syndrome is a rare systemic
      disease characterized by a neonatal progeroid appearance (not associated with
      other manifestations of premature aging) associated with facial dysmorphism
      (e.g. macrocephaly or arrested hydrocephaly proptosis downslanting palpebral
      fissures retrognathia) generalized extreme congenital lack of subcutaneous fat
      tissue (except in the breast and iliac region) and incomplete signs of Marfan
      syndrome (mainly severe myopia joint hyperextensibility and arachnodactyly).
