  TextSection:
    Contents: Collecting duct carcinoma is a rare aggressive subtype of renal cell
      carcinoma which originates from the epithelium of the distal collecting ducts
      and usually manifests with hematuria flank pain palpable abdominal mass or nonspecific
      symptoms such as fatigue weight loss or fever. Patients are often asymptomatic
      for long periods of time and therefore disease is often locally advanced or
      metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In cases with metastatic spread bone pain
      cough dyspnea pneumonia or neurological compromise may be associated.
