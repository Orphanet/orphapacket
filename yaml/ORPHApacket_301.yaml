      the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord that can occur in both children
      and adults and that is characterized by wide a range of clinical manifestations
      depending on the location of the tumor such as intracranial hypertension for
      tumors originating in the posterior fossa behavioural changes and pyramidal
      signs for supratentorial tumors and dysesthesia for tumors of the spinal cord.
