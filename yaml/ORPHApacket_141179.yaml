  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-involuting congenital hemangiomas (NICH) are a distinctive type
      of large congenital hemangioma that are fully formed <i>in utero</i> and differ
      from rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas (RICH; see this term) mainly
      because they do not undergo a postnatal involuting phase.
