  TextSection:
    Contents: This syndrome is an isolated upper limb mesomelic dysplasia. It has
      been described in four patients from two unrelated families (a man and his daughter
      and a Lebanese man and his son). Patients present with ulnar hypoplasia with
      severe radial bowing but normal stature. The mode of transmission is likely
      to be autosomal dominant with variable expressivity.
