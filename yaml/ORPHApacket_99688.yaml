  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by skin hair
      and nail anomalies (i.e. generalized ichthyosis congenital alopecia universalis
      dystrophic convex nails) associated with hypohidrosis without hyperthermia intellectual
      disability seizures and skeletal (e.g. proportionate short stature platyspondyly)
      and intestinal (e.g. congenital aganglionic megacolon) anomalies. Facial dysmorphism
      includes frontal bossing blepharophimosis large ears low nasal bridge and small
      nose. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1992.
