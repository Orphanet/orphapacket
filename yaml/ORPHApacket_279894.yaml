  TextSection:
    Contents: Toxic maculopathy due to antimalarial drugs is a rare acquired eye disease
      due to long-term exposure to chloroquine (CQ) or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) characterized
      by a slowly progressive usually non-reversible development of bilateral atrophic
      bull's-eye maculopathy (progressive loss of central vision acuity reduced color
      vision and central scotoma) which in severe cases can spread over the entire
      fundus leading to widespread retinal atrophy and visual loss.
