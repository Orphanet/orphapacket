  TextSection:
    Contents: Toxic maculopathy due to antimalarial drugs is a rare acquired eye disease
      due to long-term exposure to chloroquinine (CQ) or hydrochloroquinine (HCQ)
      characterized by a slowly progressive usually non-reversible development of
      bilateral atrophic bull's-eye maculopathy (progressive loss of central vision
      acuity reduced color vision and central scotoma) which in severe cases can spread
      over the entire fundus leading to widespread retinal atrophy and visual loss.
