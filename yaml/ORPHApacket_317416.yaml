  TextSection:
    Contents: T-B+ severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; see this term) is a group
      of rare monogenic primary immunodeficiency disorders characterized by a lack
      of functional peripheral T lymphocytes with presence of B lymphocytes resulting
      in early-onset severe respiratory viral bacterial or fungal infections diarrhea
      and failure to thrive.
