  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular tumor characterized by an ill-defined slowly growing
      asymptomatic cutaneous plaque or nodule mostly involving the limbs in fewer
      cases the trunk. The tumor is composed of lymphatic-like channels with prominent
      intraluminal papillary tufts with hyaline cores lined by hobnail endothelial
      cells. It is locally aggressive while metastasis is rare. Infants and children
      are much more often affected than adults.
