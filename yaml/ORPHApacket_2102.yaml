  TextSection:
    Contents: GTP-cyclohydrolase I deficiency an autosomal recessive genetic disorder
      is one of the causes of malignant hyperphenylalaninemia due to tetrahydrobiopterin
      deficiency. Not only does tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency cause hyperphenylalaninemia
      it is also responsible for defective neurotransmission of monoamines because
      of malfunctioning tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases both tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent
      hydroxylases.
