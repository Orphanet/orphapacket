  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by a variable clinical phenotype
      ranging from fetal hydrops and postnatal hypotonia bradycardia and respiratory
      failure resulting in death in the neonatal period to infantile onset of episodes
      of acute cardiopulmonary failure associated with severe lactic acidosis and
      slowly progressive muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy shows reduced activity of
      mitochondrial complexes I III and IV.
