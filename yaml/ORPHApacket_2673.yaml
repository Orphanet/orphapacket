    Contents: Neurofaciodigitorenal syndrome is a rare multiple developmental anomalies
      syndrome characterized by neurological abnormalities (including megalencephaly
      hypotonia intellectual disability abnormal EEG) dysmorphic facial features (high
      prominent forehead grooved nasal tip ptosis ear anomalies) and acrorenal defects
      (such as triphalangism broad halluces unilateral renal agenesis). Additionally
      intrauterine growth restriction short stature and congenital heart defects may
      be associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
