    Contents: A rare form of familial hypoaldosteronism characterized by adult onset
      of subnormal plasma aldosterone with elevated plasma renin activity hyperkalemia
      metabolic acidosis and hypotension. Signs and symptoms are typically mild and
      affected individuals may be clinically asymptomatic and diagnosed only after
      biochemical screening.
