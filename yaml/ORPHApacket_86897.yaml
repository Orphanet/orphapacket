  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dendritic cell tumor characterized by an aggressive high-grade
      neoplasm derived from Langerhans cells most commonly extranodal and multifocal
      involving the skin and underlying soft tissue as well as lung liver spleen and
      bone. Primary nodal involvement is seen in a minority of patients. Immune-phenotyping
      and the presence of Birbeck granules on ultrastructural examination reveal the
      Langerhans cell derivation of the neoplastic cells. Prognosis is generally poor.
