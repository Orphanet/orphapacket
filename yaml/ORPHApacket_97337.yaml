  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare osteochrondrosis characterized by chronic traction injury of
      the immature osteotendinous junction where the patellar tendon inserts into
      the inferior pole of the patella. It is typically seen in active adolescents.
      Patients present with point tenderness at the inferior pole of the patella associated
      with focal swelling and restriction of knee joint range of movement. Radiographic
      features include thickening of the proximal patellar tendon (potentially followed
      by dystrophic calcification and/or ossification) and fragmentation of the inferior
      pole of the patella.
