  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic eye disease characterized by microcornea coloboma of
      the iris and the optic disc axial enlargement of the globe staphyloma and severe
      myopia. Additional manifestations are mild cornea plana iridocorneal angle abnormalities
      with elevation of intraocular pressure and shallow anterior chamber depth. Variable
      expressivity of the phenotype has been described including unilateral or bilateral
      involvement or variable extent of coloboma among other features.
