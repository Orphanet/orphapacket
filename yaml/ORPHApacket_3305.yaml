  TextSection:
    Contents: Tetraploidy is an extremely rare chromosomal anomaly polyploidy when
      an affected individual has four copies of each chromosome instead of two resulting
      in total of 92 chromosomes in each cell. The phenotype is severe with multiple
      congenital anomalies including central nervous system ocular cardiac renal and/or
      genital malformations and limb defects. Most patients show severe intrauterine
      growth retardation hypotonia failure to thrive and developmental delay. It is
      usually associated with miscarriage.
