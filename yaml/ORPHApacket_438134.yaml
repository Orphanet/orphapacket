  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis caused by homozygous
      mutations in the <i>PCNA</i> gene and characterized by neurodegeneration postnatal
      growth retardation prelingual sensorineural hearing loss premature aging ocular
      and cutaneous telangiectasia learning difficulties photophobia and photosensitivity
      with evidence of predisposition to sun-induced malignancy. Progressive neurologic
      deterioration leads to gait disturbances muscle weakness speech and swallowing
      difficulties and progressive cognitive decline.
