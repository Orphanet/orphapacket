  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature-delayed bone age due to thyroid hormone metabolism deficiency
      is a rare genetic congenital hypothyroidism disorder characterized by mild global
      developmental delay in childhood short stature delayed bone age and abnormal
      thyroid and selenium levels in serum (high total and free T4 concentrations
      low T3 high reverse T3 normal to high TSH decreased selenium). Intellectual
      disability primary infertility hypotonia muscle weakness and impaired hearing
      have also been reported.
