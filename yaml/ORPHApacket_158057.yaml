    Contents: A rare secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis characterized by
      occurring as either initial presentation of a malignant disease or at any stage
      during chemotherapy. The common associated malignancies are lukemias B-cell
      T-cell or NK-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma. Typical clinical manifestation
      includes fever hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenias combined with specific laboratory
      findings.
