    Contents: Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is a rare malignant tumor originating
      from the ampulla of Vater that can present with symptoms of general fatigue
      loss of appetite weight loss nausea vomiting abdominal pain and most commonly
      painless obstructive jaundice. The tumor is believed to arise from duodenal
      biliary or pancreatic epilthelium resulting in the respective histological types.
      In general carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater has a better prognosis (5-year
      survival rate of 45%) than cancers of the distal bile duct and pancreas.
