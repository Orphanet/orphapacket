  TextSection:
    Contents: "A rare neurometabolic disease due to a lipoic acid biosynthesis defect\
      \ with a highly variable phenotype typically characterized by early-onset acute\
      \ or subacute developmental delay or regression frequently associated with feeding\
      \ difficulties. Clinical severity is variable and may range from mild cases\
      \ which present a later onset with slow neurological deterioration and general\
      \ improvement over time to severe cases with clinical signs since birth and\
      \ leading to early death. Associated manifestations include hypotonia vision\
      \ loss respiratory failure seizures and intellectual disability. Brain magnetic\
      \ resonance imaging frequently shows cavitating leukoencephalopathy with lesions\
      \ in the periventricular/central white matter and parieto-occi\xEEtal lobes."
