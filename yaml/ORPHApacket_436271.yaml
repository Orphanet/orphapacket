  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by a distinctive MRI pattern
      of cavitating leukodystrophy predominantly in the posterior region of the cerebral
      hemispheres. The clinical picture varies widely between acute neurometabolic
      decompensation in infancy with loss of developmental milestones seizures and
      pyramidal signs rapidly evolving into spastic tetraparesis to subtle neurological
      symptoms presenting in adolescence. The disease course tends to stabilize over
      time in most patients and marked recovery of milestones may be observed.
