  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypercholesterolemia due to cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency
      is a rare genetic sterol metabolism disorder characterized by increased LDL
      cholesterol serum levels (which are resistant to treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
      A reductase inhibitors) hypertrigliceridemia and decreased rate of bile acid
      excretion resulting from cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. Premature
      gallstone disease and/or premature coronary and peripheral vascular disease
      are frequently associated.
