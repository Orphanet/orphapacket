  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare sterol metabolism disorder characterized by increased LDL cholesterol
      serum levels (which are resistant to treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme
      A reductase inhibitors) hypertriglyceridemia and decreased rate of bile acid
      excretion resulting from cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. Premature
      gallstone disease and/or premature coronary and peripheral vascular disease
      are frequently associated.
