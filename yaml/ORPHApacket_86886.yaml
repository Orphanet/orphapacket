      lymph nodes by neoplastic cells of T follicular helper cell origin with a polymorphous
      inflammatory background including markedly increased follicular dendritic cells
      and EBV-positive B-cells as well as prominent proliferation of high endothelial
      venules. The spleen liver skin and bone marrow are also frequently involved.
      Patients typically present with generalized lymphadenopathy hepatosplenomegaly
      systemic symptoms and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Pruritic skin rash
