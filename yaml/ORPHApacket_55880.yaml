  TextSection:
    Contents: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor arising from cartilaginous
      tissue most frequently occuring at the ends of the femur and tibia the proximal
      end of the humerus and the pelvis; and presenting with a palpable mass and progressive
      pain. Chondrosarcoma is usually slow growing at low histological grades and
      can be well managed by intralesional curettage or en-block wide resection.
