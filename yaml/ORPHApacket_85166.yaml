  TextSection:
    Contents: Platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia (PLSD) Torrance type (PLSD-T)
      is a skeletal dysplasia characterised by severe limb shortening (short and broad
      long bones) platyspondyly with wafer-like vertebral bodies short ribs with anterior
      cupping severe hypoplasia of the lower ilia and radial bowing. Histological
      findings include slightly enlarged chondrocytes and hypercellularity. The prevalence
      is unknown. The disorder is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait and is
      caused by mutations in the C-propeptide domain of the <i>COL2A1</i> gene. Although
      PLSD-T is generally lethal survival to adulthood has been reported in two families.
