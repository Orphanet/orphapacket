  TextSection:
    Contents: Uhl anomaly is characterized by an almost complete absence of the myocardium
      in the right ventricle resulting in a thin walled nonfunctional right ventricle
      manifesting with cardiac arrhythmias and right ventricular failure. Cases of
      partial absence of right ventricular myocardium which remains asymptomatic or
      mildly symptomatic until adulthood have also been reported. Patients presenting
      with complete Uhl anomaly should be considered for cardiac transplantation.
