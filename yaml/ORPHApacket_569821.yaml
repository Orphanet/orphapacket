  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary lymphedema characterized by bilateral painless lower
      limb swelling present at birth. Prominent veins around the ankles and on the
      dorsa of the feet dysplastic and upslanting toenails due to edema of the nailbed
      and subtle dysmorphic facial features (such as high forehead hypertelorism depressed
      nasal bridge mild bilateral ear dysplasia and short neck) have also been described.
      The degree of lymphatic impairment is milder than in the otherwise clinically
      similar Milroy disease as evidenced by slightly less severe lymphedema and significantly
      more uptake of tracers on lymphoscintigraphy.
