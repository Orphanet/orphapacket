    Contents: Pili torti is a hair shaft abnormality characterized by flat hair that
      is twisted at irregular intervals. Hair is normal at birth but progressively
      stops growing long and becomes fragile. Pili torti can be isolated or occur
      in association with syndromes such as Menkes disease or Bazex syndrome (see
      these terms).
