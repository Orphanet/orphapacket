  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare amyloidosis that complicates chronic inflammatory disorders and
      is characterized by the aggregation and deposition of amyloid fibrils composed
      of serum amyloid A protein an acute phase reactant. The kidney is involved in
      virtually all patients and dominates the clinical picture. Other frequently
      involved sites are the liver the spleen suprarenal gland gut and less frequently
      the heart.
