    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by childhood to adult onset of slowly progressive sometimes asymmetric
      distal muscle weakness and atrophy as well as sensory impairment predominantly
      of the lower limbs. Additional common features include pes cavus kyphoscoliosis
