  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of congenital pulmonary airway malformation characterized
      by a multicystic mass of non-functioning lung tissue with one or more dominant
      cysts of 2 to 10 cm in diameter which may be surrounded by smaller cysts. The
      lesions have intracystic communications can be connected to the tracheobronchial
      tree and are usually unilateral involving a single lobe. Small lesions may remain
      asymptomatic while most cases present with respiratory distress in the neonatal
      period or in infancy or with recurrent respiratory infections later in life.
      Pulmonary hypoplasia and severe fetal hydrops are rare complications. The condition
      is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary malignancy such as bronchoalveolar
      carcinoma.
