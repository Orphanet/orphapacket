  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pituitary disease characterized by hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic
      necrosis of the pituitary gland. Clinical manifestations typically comprise
      sudden and severe headache (often with nausea and vomiting) visual disturbances
      (visual-field defects loss of visual acuity) oculomotor palsies and variable
      degrees of altered consciousness ranging from lethargy to coma. Acute endocrine
      dysfunction may also be present most commonly corticotropic deficiency with
      severe hypotension and hyponatremia as well as secondary adrenal failure but
      also thyrotropic and gonadotropic deficiency.
