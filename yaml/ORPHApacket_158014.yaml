    Contents: A rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by infiltration
      of lymph nodes or extranodal tissues by non-malignant histiocytes displaying
      emperipolesis a non-destructive phagocytosis of lymphocytes or erythrocytes.
      Most typical presentation is as a massive cervical lymphadenopathy in adolescents
      and young adults. Most frequent sites of extranodal disease are skin soft tissue
