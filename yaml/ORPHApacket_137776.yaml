  TextSection:
    Contents: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 2 is a rare arthrogryposis
      syndrome characterized by multiple congenital contractures (typically extended
      elbows and flexed knees) micrognathia anterior horn cell degeneration skeletal
      muscle atrophy (mainly in the lower limbs) presence of a markedly distended
      urinary bladder and absence of hydrops pterygia and bone fractures. Other craniofacial
      (e.g. cleft palate facial palsy) and ocular (e.g. anisocoria retinal detachment)
      anomalies may be additionally observed. The disease is usually neonatally lethal
      however survival into adolescence has been reported.
