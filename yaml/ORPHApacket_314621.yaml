  TextSection:
    Contents: Duplication of the pituitary gland is a rare midline cerebral malformation
      disorder characterized by duplicated pituitary stalks and/or glands within duplicated
      sella. Patients may present various degrees of facial dysmorphism and endocrine
      abnormalities including precocious puberty hypogonadism hypothyroidism and/or
      hyperprolactinemia as well as associated congenital anomalies such as clift
      lip/palate bifid nasal bridge/tongue/uvula hypothalamic enlargement with or
      without hamartoma nasopharyngeal tumors corpus callosum agenesis/hypoplasia
      basilar artery duplication and/or vertebral defects (in particular duplication
      of the odontoid process).
