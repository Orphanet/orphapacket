  TextSection:
    Contents: B4GALT1-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation characterised
      by macrocephaly due to Dandy-Walker malformation hydrocephaly hypotonia myopathy
      and coagulation anomalies. To date only one case has been reported. The syndrome
      is associated with mutations in the <i>GALT1</i> gene (localised to region q13
      of chromosome 9) leading to a deficiency in the Golgi apparatus enzyme beta-1,4-galactosyl
      transferase.
