  TextSection:
    Contents: Scorpion envenomation is a rare intoxication caused by a scorpion sting
      which typically manifests with localized pain edema erythema and paresthesias
      at the site of the sting and when severe progresses to produce systemic symptoms
      of variable severity that include respiratory difficulties abnormal systemic
      blood pressure cardiac arrhythmia and a combination of parasympathetic (i.e.
      excessive salivation and lacrimation diaphoresis miosis frequent urination diarrhea
      vomiting priapism) and sympathetic (e.g. hyperthermia hyperglycemia mydriasis)
      manifestations. Neurological manifestations may also be associated such as abnormal
      eye movements blurred vision agitation and restlessness as well as muscle fasciculations
      and spasms. Signs and symptoms are highly variable and in most severe cases
      may lead to cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema.
