  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized
      by severe early-onset salt-wasting adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous/female
      external genitalia (irrespective of chromosomal sex) due to mutations in the
      <i>CYP11A1</i> gene. Milder cases may present delayed onset of adrenal gland
      dysfunction and genitalia phenotype may range from normal male to female in
      individuals with 46,XY karyotype. Imaging studies reveal hypoplastic/absent
      adrenal glands and biochemical findings include low serum cortisol mineralocorticoids
      androgens and sodium with elevated potassium levels.
