  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by moderate intellectual disability dysmorphic facial features (such as prominent
      glabella synophrys and prognathism) generalized hirsutism bilateral single palmar
      creases and seizures. Additional reported manifestations include slowly progressive
      neurological deterioration with muscular weakness and impaired gait and balance
      as well as hypogammaglobulinemia with specific absence of plasma and/or secretory
      IgA among others. Brain imaging may show mild cerebellar atrophy and thin corpus
      callosum.
