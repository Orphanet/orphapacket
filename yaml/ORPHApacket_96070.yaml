  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal trisomy 2p is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from
      the partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 2 with a highly variable
      phenotype principally characterized by pre- and post-natal growth failure global
      developmental delay facial dysmorphism (incl. high forehead/frontal bossing
      abnormal ear shape and/or position hypertelorism/telecanthus broad/depressed
      nasal bridge) and ocular anomalies (e.g. exophthalmos retinal hypopigmentation
      optic nerve and foveal hypoplasia). Other reported anomalies include generalized
      hypotonia pectus excavatum long fingers and toes syndactyly congenital heart
      (e.g. ventricular and atrial septal defects) and neural tube defects seizures
      pulmonary hypoplasia diaphragmatic hernia and urogenital anomalies.
