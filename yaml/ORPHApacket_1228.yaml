  TextSection:
    Contents: Banki syndrome is a synostosis syndrome reported in a single Hungarian
      family in which members of 3 generations showed lunotriquetral synostosis clinodactyly
      clinometacarpy brachymetacarpy and leptometacarpy (thin diaphysis). It appeared
      to be a unique dominant mutation. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1965.
