  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by underdevelopment
      of the optic nerve with a subnormal number of optic nerve axons. The condition
      may be unilateral or bilateral and can occur as an isolated defect or accompany
      other ocular or cerebral abnormalities. Funduscopic examination reveals a small
      optic disc often associated with the ''double-ring'' sign a ring of hypo- or
      hyperpigmentation surrounding the disc. Clinically vision may be severely impaired
      or remain unaffected.
