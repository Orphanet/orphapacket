  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic dystonia characterized predominantly by laryngeal dystonia/spasmodic
      dysphonia mostly followed by cervical and generalized dystonia. Upper and lower
      limb dystonia with the latter leading to a "hobby horse" gait (with toe walking
      stiff legs and a skipping gait) craniofacial and/or oro-pharyngeal dystonia
      have been reported in some patients. Severity and rate of progression vary among
      affected individuals ; some patients may have laryngeal or cervical dystonia
      as a life-long isolated feature however most patients present with dystonia
      in other body sites.
