  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by an
      abnormal immune response to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection caused by hemizygous
      mutations in the X-linked <i>SH2D1A</i> gene resulting in B cell lymphoproliferation
      and manifesting with various phenotypes which include EBV-driven severe or fulminant
      mononucleosis hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (presenting with fulminant
      hepatitis hepatic necrosis bone marrow hypoplasia and neurological involvement)
      hypogammaglobulinemia and B-cell lymphoma. Additional variable manifestations
      include vasculitis lymphomatoid granulomatosis aplastic anemia and chronic gastritis.
      Occasionally T-cell lymphoma may be observed. Laboratory findings include normal
      or increased activated T cells and reduced memory B cells.
