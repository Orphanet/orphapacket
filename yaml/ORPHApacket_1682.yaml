    Contents: A rare association syndrome reported in several members of two families
      to date characterized by arterial dissection occurring at an early age and presenting
      with a range of manifestations depending on the vascular territory involved
      (ex. headache dysphasia hemiparesis) in association with cystic medial necrosis
      and multiple lentigines (brown and black in color and mainly affecting the skin
      of the trunk and extremities).
