  TextSection:
    Contents: Facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy is characterised initially
      by paraesthesia and numbness in the region of the trigeminal nerve distribution
      which later progresses to involve the scalp neck upper trunk and upper limbs.
      Onset of motor manifestations occurs later with cramps fasciculations dysphagia
      dysarthria muscle weakness and atrophy. This syndrome has been described in
      four males and appears to be a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease.
