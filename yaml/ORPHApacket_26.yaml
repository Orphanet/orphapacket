  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism characterized
      by megaloblastic anemia lethargy failure to thrive developmental delay intellectual
      deficit and seizures. There are four complementation classes of cobalamin defects
      (cblC cblD cblF and cblJ) that are responsible for methylmalonic acidemia -
      homocystinuria (methylmalonic acidemia - homocystinuria cblC cblD cblF and cblJ).
