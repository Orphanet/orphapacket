  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy disease characterized
      by progressive peripheral axonal sensorimotor neuropathy (of variable severity)
      affecting predominantly the distal lower limbs associated with progressive variably
      severe optic atrophy which frequently leads to visual loss. Patients typically
      present distal limb muscle weakness and atrophy hypo/areflexia foot deformities
      poor visual acuity (often with a central scotoma) nystagmus and reduced peripheral
      and nocturnal vision. Additional reported manifestations include sensorineural
      hearing loss major joint contractures anosmia scoliosis/lumbar hyperlordosis
      cognitive impairment and vocal cord paresis.
