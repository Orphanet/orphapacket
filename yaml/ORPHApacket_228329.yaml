  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by developmental
      delay psychomotor regression hypotonia seizures ataxia movement disorders and
      visual impairment. It may present classically with infantile-onset (6-18 months)
      however late infantile (18 months-4 years) juvenile (4 years-early adolescence)
      or adult-onset (mid 20s-mid 30s) have also been described. Disease progression
      is rapid in both infantile/late infantile onset patients manifesting with progressive
      and rapid loss of speech early cognitive and motor decline impaired gait function
      myoclonus vision loss (observed bit later in late infantile form) and brain
      atrophy. Infantile form is characterized by a short lifespan preceeded by a
      relatively long steady progression following the rapid decline. Disease progression
      is slow in juvenile-onset and protracted in adult-onset patients. Psychosis
      in juvenile-onset patients depression and parkinsonism in adult-onset patients
      are reported in addition to the common clinical symptoms.
