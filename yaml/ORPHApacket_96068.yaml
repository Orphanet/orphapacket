    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 22 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by prenatal and postnatal growth
      delay mild to severe intellectual disability hemiatrophy webbed neck ocular
      and cutaneous pigmentary anomalies craniofacial dysmorphic features (e.g. microcephaly
      upslanted palpebral fissures ptosis ear malformations flat nasal bridge micrognathia)
      and cardiac abnormalities (including ventricular and atrial septal defect pulmonary
      or aortic stenosis). Hearing loss and limb malformations (e.g. cubitus valgus
