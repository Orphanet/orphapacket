  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive disorder of lysine metabolism characterized
      by elevated levels of lysine in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood. Hyperlysinemia
      type I has been associated with a highly variable phenotype including seizures
      hypotonia and mild psychomotor delay although isolated hyperlysinemia is probably
      a benign condition.
