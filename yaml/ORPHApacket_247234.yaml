  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-hereditary degenerative ataxia disease characterized by a
      slowly progressive cerebellar syndrome (with ataxia of stance and gait upper
      limb dysmetria and intention tremor ataxic speech and oculomotor abnormalities)
      presenting in adulthood (at around 50 years of age) that is not due to a known
      cause. Extracerebellar symptoms (e.g. decreased vibration sense and absent or
      decreased ankle reflexes) polyneuropathy and mild autonomic dysfunction may
      also be present. Mild cognitive impairment has also rarely been reported.
