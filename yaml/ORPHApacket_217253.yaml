  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare limbic encephalitis characterized by the presence of autoantibodies
      against NMDA receptors in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. It may be of paraneoplastic
      (most commonly associated with ovarian teratoma) or non-paraneoplastic origin
      and is life-threatening but potentially treatable. Patients present with acute
      behavioral change psychosis and catatonia rapidly progressing to seizures memory
      deficit dyskinesias speech problems and autonomic and breathing dysregulation.
