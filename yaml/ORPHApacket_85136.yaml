  TextSection:
    Contents: Cystic leukoencephalopathy without megalencephaly is characterised by
      non-progressive leukoencephalopathy bilateral cysts in the anterior part of
      the temporal lobe cerebral white matter anomalies and severe psychomotor impairment.
      Less than 50 patients have been described in the literature so far. Inheritance
      is most likely autosomal recessive.
