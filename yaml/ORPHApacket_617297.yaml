  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder related to monochorionic twin pregnancy characterized
      by complete or partial absence of cardiac development in one twin (''acardiac
      twin'') and blood supply of both circulations by the morphologically normal
      co-twin (''pump twin'') via an arterioarterial anastomosis. In most cases the
      acardiac twin has well developed legs and pelvis but no cephalic pole thoracic
      organs and upper extremities. The condition is associated with a high risk of
      perinatal death of the pump twin due to a combination of high-output cardiac
      failure and polyhydramnios-related pre-term birth. Hypoxia and intrauterine
      growth restriction are also seen in the pump twin.
