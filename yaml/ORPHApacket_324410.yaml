    Contents: X-linked intellectual disability-cardiomegaly-congestive heart failure
      syndrome is a rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability disorder characterized
      by profound intellectual disability global developmental delay with absent speech
      seizures large joint contractures abnormal position of thumbs and middle-age
      onset of cardiomegaly and atrioventricular valve abnormalities resulting in
      subsequent congestive heart failure. Additional features include variable facial
      dysmorphism (notably large ears with overfolded helix) and large testes.
