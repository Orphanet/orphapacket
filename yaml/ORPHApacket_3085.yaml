  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic retinitis pigmentosa characterized by pigmentary retinopathy
      diabetes mellitus with hyperinsulinism acanthosis nigricans secondary cataracts
      neurogenic deafness short stature mild hypogonadism in males and polycystic
      ovaries with oligomenorrhea in females. Inheritance is thought to be autosomal
      recessive. It can be distinguished from Alstrom syndrome (see this term) by
      the presence of intellectual disability and the absence of renal insufficiency.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1993.
