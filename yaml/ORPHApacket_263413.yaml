  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular tumor characterized by a malignant space-occupying lesion
      composed of cells variably recapitulating features of normal endothelium. It
      mostly develops as a cutaneous tumor and is much less frequently located in
      the deep soft tissue. Clinical presentation is an enlarging mass sometimes with
      symptoms like coagulopathy anemia persistent hematoma or bruisability. Some
      tumors are associated with pre-existing conditions e. g. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome
      Maffucci syndrome or following radiation among others. Older age retroperitoneal
      location large size and high mitotic activity are predictors for poor outcome.
