  TextSection:
    Contents: Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 16 is a uniparental disomy
      of maternal origin which might be associated with intrauterine growth retardation
      and an elevated risk of congenital malformations. Healthy carriers have also
      been reported. In addition cases of homozygosity for a recessive disease mutation
      for which the mother was a carrier have been described and specific phenotype
      depends on the inherited disorder.
