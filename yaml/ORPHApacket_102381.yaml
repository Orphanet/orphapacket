  TextSection:
    Contents: A subgroup of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) associated with
      treatment of an unrelated neoplastic disease with cytotoxic agents like etoposid
      doxorubicin daunorubicin and others. The neoplastic cells often show rearrangements
      involving the mixed lineage leukemia gene at 11q23. This subgroup of t-MN is
      typically associated with overt leukemia without preceding myelodysplastic syndrome
      developing 2-3 years after exposure presenting with non-specific symptoms related
      to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and bruising recurrent infections
      bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement.
