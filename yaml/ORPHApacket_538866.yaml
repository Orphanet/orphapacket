    Contents: A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum characterized by multiple painful
      sterile pustules with a surrounding erythematous halo predominantly occurring
      on the trunk and extensor surfaces of the limbs and potentially persisting for
      months. Histopathology shows a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate and subcorneal
      neutrophilic micropustules. The condition is commonly associated with inflammatory
      bowel disease.
