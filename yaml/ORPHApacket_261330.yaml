  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from the partial deletion
      of the long arm of chromosome 22 outside the DiGeorge critical region. The phenotype
      is characterized by prematurity pre- and post-natal growth retardation developmental
      delay (particularly speech) mild intellectual disability variable cardiac defects
      and minor skeletal anomalies (such as clinodactyly). Dysmorphic features present
      in half of the individuals include microcephaly arched eyebrows deep set eyes
      narrow upslanting palpebral fissures ear abnormalities (low-set ears tags and
      pits) hypoplastic alae nasi smooth philtrum down-turned mouth thin upper lip
      retro/micrognatia and pointed chin. For certain very distal deletions including
      the <i>SMARCB1</i> gene there is a risk of developing malignant rhabdoid tumours.
      Most deletions are <i>de novo </i>.
