  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare group of spinal dysraphisms also referred to as spina bifida
      occulta with a high variability in terms of severity,characterized by the absence
      of exposed neural tissue. The skin overlying the abnormality remains intact
      although the skin itself may be abnormal with features such as hairy patch of
      skin crater or haemangioma. These skin features are known as the cutaneous stigmata
      of spinal dysraphism.
