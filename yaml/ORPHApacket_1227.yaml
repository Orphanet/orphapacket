  TextSection:
    Contents: Bangstad syndrome is a rare endocrine disease characterized by the association
      of primordial birdheaded nanism progressive ataxia goiter primary gonadal insufficiency
      and insulin resistant diabetes mellitus. Plasma concentrations of TSH PTH LH
      FSH ACTH glucagon and insulin are usually elevated. A generalized cell membrane
      defect was suggested to be the pathophysiological abnormality in these patients.
      The mode of inheritance was thought to be autosomal recessive. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1989.
