  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic skeletal dysplasia characterized by carpal and tarsal
      synostoses (synostoses between capitate and hamate and between talus and navicular
      are always present other carpal and tarsal bones are sometimes incorporated
      into the fusion) syndactyly between the first and second fingers hypodactyly
      and polydactyly of feet and acral defects that may involve the sternum and the
      lumbosacral spine (including prominent sternum with variable pectus excavatum
      and lumbosacral spina bifida occulta). Soft tissue syndactyly dental hypoplasia/dysplasia
      wide alveolar ridge and high and narrow palate have also been reported in some
      patients.
