  TextSection:
    Contents: Ring chromosome 19 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with
      a highly variable phenotype that may range from normal to patients with profound
      intellectual disability developmental delay learning disability (esp. speech)
      and mild dysmorphism (incl. micro/macrocephaly prominent forehead low-set and
      posteriorly rotated ears hypertelorism high nasal bridge prominent philtrum
      retro/micrognathia). Mild hypotonia and autistic-like mannerisms (e.g. hand
      opening and closing head banging) may also be associated. Other anomalies such
      as cutis laxa hearing loss syndactyly digital hypoplasia and talipes equinovarus
      have also been reported.
