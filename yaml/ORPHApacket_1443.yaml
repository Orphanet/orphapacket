      a highly variable phenotype that may range from normal to patients with profound
      intellectual disability developmental delay learning disability (esp. speech)
      and mild dysmorphism (incl. micro/macrocephaly prominent forehead low-set and
      posteriorly rotated ears hypertelorism high nasal bridge prominent philtrum
