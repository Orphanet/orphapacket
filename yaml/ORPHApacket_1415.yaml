  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital malformation syndrome characterized by an
      association of cleft lip and palate patchy pigmentary retinopathy (cat's paw)
      obstructive liver disease (cholestasis portal hypertension etc.) and obstructive
      renal disease (ectopic ureteric insertion obstruction vesicouretral reflux and
      hydronephrosis). Gastrointestinal tract involvement (malrotation gastresophageal
      reflux etc.) and cardiac involvement (coarctation of aorta pulmonary artery
      stenosis etc.) have also been reported. An overlap with Kabuki syndrome is debated.
