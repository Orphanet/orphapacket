  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign paroxysmal tonic upgaze of childhood with ataxia is a rare paroxysmal
      movement disorder characterized by episodes of sustained conjugate upward deviation
      of the eyes and down beating saccades in attempted downgaze (with preserved
      horizontal eye movements) which is accompanied by ataxic symptomatology (unsteady
      gait lack of balance and movement coordination disturbances) in an otherwise
      healthy individual. Bilateral vertical nystagmus is associated. Symptoms generally
      disappear spontaneously within 1-2 years after onset.
