  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital diazoxide-sensitive diffuse hyperinsulinism due
      to <i>ABCC8</i> variants and characterized by hypoglycemic episodes that are
      usually mild escaping detection during infancy and usually have a good clinical
      response to diazoxide. The autosomal dominant hyperinsulinism usually has a
      milder phenotype when compared to that resulting from recessive potassium (K-ATP)
      channel mutations.
