  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare congenital contracture disorder reported exclusively in
      Yup'ik Eskimos of the Kuskokwim River delta region of Alaska characterized by
      multiple contractures of large joints (predominantly the knees and ankles) that
      present at birth or during childhood but are lifelong; deformities of the spine
      pelvis and feet; and sometimes proximally or distally displaced patellae and
      muscle atrophy in the limbs with contractures. Additional radiological features
      include mild vertebral wedging elongation of the vertebral pedicle and clubbing
      of the distal clavicle. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance has been
      suggested.
