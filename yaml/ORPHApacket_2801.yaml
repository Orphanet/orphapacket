  TextSection:
    Contents: Juvenile Paget disease is a very rare form of Paget disease of the bone
      characterized by a general increase in bone turnover with increased bone resorption
      and deposition resulting in cortical and trabecular thickening and clinically
      presenting as progressive skeletal deformities growth impairment fractures vertebral
      collapse skull enlargement and sensorineural hearing loss.
