  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 7 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype mostly characterized by blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia
      body asymmetry enamel dysplasia and developmental and growth delay. Intellectual
      disability facial dysmorphism (e.g. frontal bossing abnormal palpebral fissures
      strabismus abnormally shaped ears and micrognathia) and genital anomalies (e.g.
      undescended testes) have also been observed. It has been reported to be associated
      with maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 resulting in a Silver-Russell
      syndrome phenotype. Cases with no associated malformations have also been reported.
