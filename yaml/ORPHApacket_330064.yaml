  TextSection:
    Contents: Chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) is an immunologically mediated photodermatosis
      usually observed in temperate climates and that typically develops in middle-aged
      to elderly males. CAD is characterized by eczematous and often lichenified pruritic
      patches and confluent plaques located predominantly on sun-exposed areas with
      notable sparing of eyelids skin folds and postauricular skin. It is often accompanied
      by multiple contact allergies and usually occurs in a background of either atopic
      contact allergic or seborrheic dermatitis although it can occur <i>de novo</i>.
      Resolution of photosensitivity is reported in up to 50% of individuals after
      15 years or more with contact allergies persisting.
