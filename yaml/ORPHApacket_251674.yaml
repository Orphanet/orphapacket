  TextSection:
    Contents: Chordoid glioma is an extremely rare glial neoplasm occurring in the
      region of the anterior third ventricle or hypothalamus which is non-infiltrative
      and well-circumscribed and presents most frequently in middle-aged women with
      symptoms of memory loss and headaches and because of its location has a poor
      prognosis due to surgical morbidity.
