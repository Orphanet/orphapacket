    Contents: A rare central nervous system tumor characterized by a non-infiltrative
      and well-circumscribed WHO grade 2 glial neoplasm occurring in the third ventricle
      often extending to hypothalamus. Chordoid glioma presents most frequently in
      middle-aged women with symptoms of memory deficits headaches and visual loss
      related to its location. Virtually all chordoid gliomas exhibit positivity for
      GFAP and TTF1 immunostaining <i>PRKCA</i>p.D463H mutation and a specific chordoid
      glioma DNA methylation class.
