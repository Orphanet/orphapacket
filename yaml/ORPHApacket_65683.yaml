  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated focal cortical dysplasia is a rare genetic non-syndromic cerebral
      malformation due to abnormal neuronal migration disorder characterized by variable-sized
      focalized malformations located in any part(s) of the cerebral cortex which
      manifests with drug-resistant epilepsy (usually leading to intellectual disability)
      and behavioral disturbances. Abnormal MRI findings (e.g. abnormal white and/or
      grey matter signal blurred gray-white matter junction localized volume loss
      cortical thickening abnormal gyral pattern abnormal hippocampus) and variable
      histopathologic patterns are associated.
