  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized by clinical
      and histopathologic evidence of pseudoxanthoma elasticum in the absence of a
      family history or specific mutation. Patients present with predominantly cutaneous
      manifestations consisting of yellowish papules which coalesce into large plaques
      and are most commonly localized on the neck axillae groin and flexural surfaces.
      Skin biopsy shows accumulation of clumped calcified elastic fibers in the mid-dermis.
      Reported underlying factors include previous liver transplantation exposure
      to penicillamine or concomitant beta-thalassemia.
