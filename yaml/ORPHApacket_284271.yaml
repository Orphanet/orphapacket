  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary cerebellar ataxia disorder characterized by late-onset
      spinocerebellar ataxia manifesting with slowly progressive gait disturbances
      dysarthria limb and truncal ataxia and smooth-pursuit eye movement disturbance
      associated with a history of psychomotor delay from childhood. Mild atrophy
      of the cerebellar vermis and hemispheres is observed on brain imaging.
