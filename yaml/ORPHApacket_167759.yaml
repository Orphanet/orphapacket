  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare disorders comprises dentinogenesis imperfecta and dentin
      dysplasia characterized by abnormal dentin structure affecting either the primary
      or both the primary and secondary dentitions. Clinically the teeth are discolored
      and exhibit structural defects such as bulbous crowns and small pulp chambers
      on radiographs. The underlying mineralization defect often results in shearing
      of the overlying enamel leaving weakened dentin exposed and prone to wear.
