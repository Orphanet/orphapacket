  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare carcinoma of the liver characterized by one to several or many
      nodules occurring anywhere within the liver composed of neoplastic epithelial
      cells with hepatocellular differentiation. The vast majority of tumors are associated
      with chronic liver disease (such as hepatitis B or C or steatohepatitis) or
      exposure to a variety of exogenous agents. Patients may present with signs and
      symptoms related to the tumor as well as to the underlying condition. Common
      manifestations include right upper quadrant abdominal pain weight loss hepatosplenomegaly
      jaundice and ascites. Symptomatic tumors generally have poor prognosis.
