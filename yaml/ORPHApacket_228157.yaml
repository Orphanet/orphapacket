      characterized by a rapidly progressive aggressive form of multiple sclerosis
      with numerous large multifocal demyelinating lesions in deep white matter on
      cerebral MRI that usually leads to severe disability or death within weeks to
      months without remission. A relapsing form of multiple sclerosis is observed
      in surviving patients.
