  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor most often presenting in women
      over 50 years and no smokers characterized by long-lasting cough (>10 years)
      and less frequently by dispnea or wheezing. A proportion of patients are asymptomatic
      the disease being an incidental finding during routine check-ups. Diffuse pulmonary
      nodules and mosaic attenuation can be detected by CT-scan however only histopathology
      can confirm the diagnosis detecting a multifocal hyperplasia of pulmonary neuroendocrine
      cells (carcinoid tumorlets). Ventilatory dysfunction can be obstructive and
      less often restrictive mixed or non-specific. Symptoms can progress slowly but
      sometimes lead to respiratory failure. It is considered as a precursor for pulmonary
      carcinoid tumor.
