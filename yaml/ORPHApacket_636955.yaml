  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autoimmune bullous skin disease characterized by the formation
      of subcorneal blisters mediated by autoantibodies against desmoglein 1 affecting
      predominantly seborrheic areas such as the head neck and upper trunk but without
      any mucosal involvement. The lesions may be worsened by exposure to UV light
      and typically progress over weeks or months. The disease frequently occurs in
      children and young adults and is endemic to rural areas of Brazil and other
      countries in South America as well as North Africa.
