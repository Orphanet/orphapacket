  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neoplastic disease characterized by the occurrence of a hormonal
      syndrome resulting from secretion of humoral factors (including polypeptides
      vasoactive amines and prostaglandins) from a functional neuroendocrine tumor
      (particularly from the midgut) typically manifesting with increased bowel movements
      and diarrhea episodic vasoactive flushes (particularly of the face) hypotension
      tachycardia venous telangiectasia dyspnea and bronchospasms as well as long-term
      fibrotic changes in the mesentery retroperitoneum and of the cardiac valves.
