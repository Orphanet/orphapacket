  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare closed dysraphism with terminal stalk characterized by persistant
      rudimentary spinal cord below conus. It contains non-functional neural tissue
      and is typically isolated. The diagnostic is suggested by attenuated conus without
      fat further confirmed by pathological analysis (glioneuronal core with ependyma-lined
      lumen nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia). Differential diagnostic with intraoperative
      neurophysiological monitoring is mandatory as neuroimaging fails to distinguish
      it from functional conus.
