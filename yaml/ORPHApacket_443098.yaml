    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia with increased bone density characterized
      by slowly progressive endosteal hyperostosis and osteosclerosis exclusively
      of the skull base and the calvaria resulting in entrapment and dysfunction of
      cranial nerves I II V VII and VIII. First symptoms often appear during the second
      decade of life and include disturbances in smell vision facial sensation and
      expression hearing and balance as well as headaches due to increased ocular
      and intracranial pressure. After the fourth decade radiological progression
      is minimal although decreased intracranial volume can lead to death in severe
      cases.
