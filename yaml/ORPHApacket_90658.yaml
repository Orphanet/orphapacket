  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of CMT1 characterized by a variable clinical presentation.
      Onset within the first two years of life with a delay in walking is not uncommon;
      however onset may occur later. CMT1E is caused by point mutations in the <i>PMP22</i>
      (17p12) gene. The disease severity depends on the particular <i>PMP22</i> mutation
      with some cases being very mild and even resembling hereditary neuropathy with
      liability to pressure palsies while others having an earlier onset with a more
      severe phenotype (reminiscent of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome) than that seen in
      CMT1A caused by gene duplication. These severe cases may also report deafness
      and much slower motor nerve conduction velocities compared to CMT1A patients.
