  TextSection:
    Contents: CLIPPERS is a rare neuroinflammatory disorder characterized by brainstem-predominant
      encephalomyelitis which typically presents with cerebellar and cranial nerve
      manifestations (gait ataxia dysarthria visual disorders parasthesias) as well
      as brainstem myelopathy and cognitive findings that respond to steroid treatment.
      Punctate curvilinear post-gadolinium contrast enhancement predominantly in the
      pons and cerebellum is observed on brain MRI and prominent perivascular CD3+
      T-cell predominantly lymphocytic inflammation in neuropathology.
