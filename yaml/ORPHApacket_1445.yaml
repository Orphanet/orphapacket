    Contents: Ring chromosome 21 syndrome is an autosomal anomaly characterized by
      variable clinical features most commonly including growth retardation developmental
      delay intellectual disability epilepsy microcephaly short stature dysmorphic
      features hypogammaglobulinemia thrombocytopenia and unspecific skeletal anomalies
      (hemivertebrae clinodactyly syndactyly). In rare cases it has been described
      in phenotypically normal individuals.
