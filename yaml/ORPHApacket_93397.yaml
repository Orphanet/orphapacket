  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dysostosis with brachydactyly characterized by variable combinations
      of features of brachydactyly types A2 (such as delta-shaped middle phalanx of
      the second finger or toe) and D (short broad distal phalanx of the thumb) and
      other types of brachydactyly (symphalangism) as well as unique features (dislocatable
      thumbs lateral deviation of second toes with elevation of first toes). There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1989.
