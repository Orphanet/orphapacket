  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder due to poisoning caused by toxins in the bite of a venomous
      snake. Envenoming can also be caused by spraying of venom into the eyes. Depending
      on venom composition and other factors consequences range from local tissue
      damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects. Severe manifestations
      include paralysis bleeding disorders kidney failure or permanent disability
      and limb amputation due to severe local tissue destruction. Children may suffer
      more severe effects because of their lower body mass. Immediate medical attention
      in particular administration of antivenom is critical.
