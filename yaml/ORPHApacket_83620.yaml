  Synonyms:

  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare genetic gastroenterological disease characterized by severe
      malabsorptive diarrhea (requiring parenteral nutrition and disappearing at fasting)
      due to a lack of intestinal enteroendocrine cells. It is associated with early-onset
      (within the first weeks of life) dehydration metabolic acidosis and diabetes
      mellitus (that can develop until late childhood). Patient may display various
      degrees of pancreatic insufficiency that does not explain diarrhea as it is
      not reduced with pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Central hypogonadism (developing
      in the second decade) as well as an association with celiac disease have been
      reported.
