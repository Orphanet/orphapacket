  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by childhood onset of progressive proximal weakness of the shoulder and pelvic
      girdle muscles resulting in difficulty walking scapular winging calf hypertrophy
      and contractures of the Achilles tendon which lead to a tiptoe gait pattern.
      Cardiac and respiratory involvement is rare.
