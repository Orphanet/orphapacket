  TextSection:
    Contents: Fetal minoxidil syndrome is characterized by a group of symptoms that
      may be observed in a fetus or newborn when the mother has taken minoxidil during
      pregnancy. Minoxidil is used in the treatment of malignant renal hypertension
      and as a topical solution to induce scalp hair growth. Hypertrichosis that gradually
      diminishes during the first six postnatal months has been reported. Additional
      reported features include cardiac (congenital great vessel transposition and
      pulmonary valve stenosis) neurodevelopmental (caudal regression sequence) (see
      these terms) gastrointestinal renal and limb malformations. Conclusive studies
      are however not available.
