  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare renal disease characterized by persistent excess urinary calcium
      excretion in the absence of an underlying systemic disease and hypercalcemia.
      The condition leads to an increased risk for the formation of kidney stones
      and nephrocalcinosis as well as reduced bone mineral density with increased
      incidence of fractures in some patients.
