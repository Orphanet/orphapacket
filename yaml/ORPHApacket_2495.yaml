  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mostly benign neoplastic disease characterized by a primary tumor
      of the meninges usually located intracranially (~90%) but spinal meningiomas
      occur as well. Clinical symptoms relate to the location of the tumor and may
      include seizures focal neurological deficits (sensory-motor or visual symptoms
      cranial nerve dysfunction) vascular complications (occlusion of cerebral blood
      vessels deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism) chronically increased intracranial
      pressure neurocognitive impairment and/or loss of bladder/anus sphincter control.
