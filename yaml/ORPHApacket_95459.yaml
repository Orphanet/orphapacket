  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital tricuspid malformation characterized by narrowing
      of the tricuspid valve orifice due to congenital valve anomalies such as incompletely
      developed leaflets shortened and malformed chordae tendineae small annulus and/or
      abnormal number and size of papillary muscles resulting in right ventricular
      inflow obstruction. Clinical presentation depends on the degree of stenosis
      as well as the presence or absence of additional cardiac anomalies and includes
      easy fatigability swelling of the lower limbs and hepatomegaly among others.
