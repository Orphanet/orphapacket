    Contents: Fixed drug eruption is a rare toxic dermatosis disorder characterized
      by the appearance of a drug-induced rash which typically manifests with small

      result in long-lasting pigmentation and which recurr (usually at the same site)
      upon reexposure to the causative medication.
