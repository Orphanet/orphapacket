  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hypersensitivity reaction characterized by the appearance of
      erythematous or violaceous round sometimes painful plaques that may or may not
      result in long-lasting pigmentation and which recur (usually at the same site)
      upon re-exposure to the causative medication. The severe form of the disease
      generalized bullous fixed drug eruption occurs typically in the elderly and
      may be life-threatening. Onset usually occurs 30 minutes to several hours after
      administration of the causal medication. Many medications including paracetamol
      have been implicated. The disease may rarely be induced by food. Histology is
      characterized by interface dermatitis or epidermal necrolysis in bullous forms.
