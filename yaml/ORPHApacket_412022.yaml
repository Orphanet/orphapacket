      filtering blebs syndrome is a syndromic developmental defect of the eye characterized
      by dislocated or subluxated crystalline lenses anterior segment abnormalities
      and distinctive facial features such as flat cheeks and a prominent beaked nose.
      Affected individuals may develop nontraumatic conjunctival cysts also referred
      to as filtering blebs.
