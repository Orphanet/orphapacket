  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary disorder of bilirubin metabolism characterized by
      unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to a either a complete (type 1) or partial
      and inducible (type 2) hepatic deficit of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 activity.
      The disorder manifests with neonatal jaundice with a risk of developing bilirubin
      encephalopathy.
