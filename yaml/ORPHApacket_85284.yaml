    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital malformation syndrome characterized
      by brain anomalies (thinning of the corpus callosum with dilatation of ventricles)
      intellectual disability ectodermal dysplasia skeletal deformities (vertebral
      anomalies scoliosis polydactyly) ear/eye anomalies (maldevelopment small optic
