  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic muscular dystrophy characterized by progressive muscle
      weakness in a scapulo-humero-peroneal and distal distribution featuring wrist
      extensor weakness finger and foot drop scapular winging mild facial weakness
      contractures of the Achilles tendon elbow and shoulder and diminished or absent
      deep tendon reflexes. A predilection for the upper extremities has been reported
      in some patients. Respiratory muscles are spared until late in the disease course.
      Age of onset progression and severity of the disease vary significantly between
      individuals. Muscle biopsy shows groups of atrophic type I fibers and increased
      internal nuclei.
