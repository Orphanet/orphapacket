  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of galactose metabolism characterized by persistent
      congenital galactosemia due to deficiency of the enzyme galactose mutarotase.
      Patients may present bilateral cataract while gastrointestinal symptoms or severe
      liver dysfunction are absent. The natural history of the disease is unknown.
      Severe complications such as neurological symptoms have not been reported under
      early treatment with a galactose-restricted diet.
