    Contents: X-linked intellectual disability Snyder type is a rare X-linked intellectual
      disability syndrome characterized by hypotonia asthenic build with diminished
      muscle mass severe generalized psychomotor delay unsteady gait and moderate
      to severe intellectual disability as well as a long thin asymmetrical face with
      prominent lower lip long fingers and toes and nasal dysarthric or absent speech.
      Bone abnormalities (e.g. osteoporosis kyphoscoliosis fractures joint contractures)
      are also characteristic. Myoclonic or myoclonic-like seizures and renal abnormalities
      have been associated in some patients.
