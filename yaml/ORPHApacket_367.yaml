  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency (Andersen's disease or amylopectinosis)
      or glycogen storage disease type 4 (GSD4) is a rare and severe form of glycogen
      storage disease which accounts for approximately 3% of all the glycogen storage
      diseases (see these terms).
