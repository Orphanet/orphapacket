  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary immune deficiency with skin involvement characterized
      by early-onset cold urticaria after generalized exposure to cold air or evaporative
      cooling and not after contact with cold objects. Additional immunologic abnormalities
      are often present - antibody deficiency recurrent infections autoimmune disease
      and symptomatic allergic disease.
