  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy presenting in the first or
      second decades of life characterized by slowly progressive proximal and distal
      muscle weakness and atrophy. Additional manifestations include contractures
      of the proximal and distal interphalangeal hand joints rigid spine restricted
      pulmonary function and mild cardiomyopathy.
