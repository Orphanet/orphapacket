    Contents: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye characterized by
      slowly progressive bilateral non-ulcerative non-inflammatory clear thinning
      of the inferior portion of the peripheral cornea (extending from the 4 o'clock
      to the 8 o'clock position) with an area of corneal protrusion above the point
      of maximal thinning resulting in against-the-rule astigmatism with decreased
      visual acuity. The central cornea is of normal thickness.
