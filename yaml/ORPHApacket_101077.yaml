  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an
      X-linked recessive inheritance pattern and the childhood onset of progressive
      distal muscle weakness and atrophy (beginning in the lower extremities and then
      affecting the upper extremities) as well as distal pansensory loss in the upper
      and lower extremities pes cavus and absent or reduced distal tendon reflexes.
      Pain and paresthesia are frequently the initial sensory symptoms.
