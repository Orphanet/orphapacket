  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic retinal disorder characterized by abnormal proliferation
      of retinal tissue resulting in the formation of retinal folds causing gliosis
      and variable degrees of visual impairment. No clinical findings other than those
      associated with the eyes have been demonstrated. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1981.
