  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of Crigler Najjar syndrome (CNS) a rare hereditary disorder of
      bilirubin metabolism characterized by unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to
      reduced and inducible activity of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. The
      disorder clinically manifests with neonatal isolated jaundice with a risk of
      developing bilirubin encephalopathy later in life due to triggers such as stress
      or infection.
