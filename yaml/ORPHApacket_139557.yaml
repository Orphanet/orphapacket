  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked distal spinal muscular atrophy type 3 is a rare distal hereditary
      motor neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive atrophy and weakness of
      distal muscles of hands and feet with normal deep tendon reflexes or absent
      ankle reflexes and minimal or no sensory loss sometimes mild proximal weakness
      in the legs and feet and hand deformities in males.
