  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by childhood onset
      of steatorrhea due to isolated pancreatic colipase deficiency while other exocrine
      pancreatic enzymes are normal. Early formation of gallstones as well as vitamin
      B12 deficiency with megaloblastic anemia have also been reported. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1982.
