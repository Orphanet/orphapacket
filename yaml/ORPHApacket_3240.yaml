  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by early-onset progressive
      leukoencephalopathy severe developmental delay early-onset or congenital deafness
      (only few cases reported without hearing loss) and visual impairment. All patients
      manifest calcifications in brain and spinal cord. Cognitive impairment seizures
      hypotonia spastic tetraplegia or quadriplegia are observed in the majority of
      the patients. Variable features may include microcephaly and anemia.
