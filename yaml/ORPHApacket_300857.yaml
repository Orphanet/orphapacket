  TextSection:
    Contents: T-cell/histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is a rare variant
      of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL; see this term) mainly affecting middle-aged
      men and often not being discovered until an advanced disease stage with involvement
      of the spleen liver and bone marrow occurring at a greater frequency than in
      DLBCL. It is often difficult to diagnose due to its similarity with other lymphoid
      diseases such as classic Hodgkin lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant
      Hodgkin lymphoma (see these terms) and has an aggressive clinical course.
