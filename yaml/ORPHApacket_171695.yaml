  TextSection:
    Contents: Parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome is a rare genetic neurological disorder
      characterized by the association of both parkinsonian (i.e. bradykinesia rigidity
      and/or rest tremor) and pyramidal (i.e. increased reflexes extensor plantar
      reflexes pyramidal weakness or spasticity) manifestations which vary according
      to the underlying associated disease (e.g. neurodegenerative disease inborn
      errors of metabolism).
