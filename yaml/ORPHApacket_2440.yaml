  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital bone development disorder characterized by a spectrum
      of terminal limb malformations including hypoplasia/absence of central rays
      of the hands and feet (that can occur in one to all four digits) variable degrees
      of median clefts of the hands and/or feet aplasia and syndactyly with a wide
      range of severity ranging from malformed central finger/toe to a lobster claw-like
      appearance of the hands and feet. It can occur as an isolated malformation or
      it can be a feature in various syndromes.
