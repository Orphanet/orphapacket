  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndrome that is principally
      characterized by the association of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with other
      endocrine tumors. The variant MEN 2A is defined by MTC associated with pheochromocytoma
      and/or primary hyperparathyroidism (MEN2A); the variant MEN 2B is defined as
      an aggressive form of MTC in association with pheochromocytoma but without primary
      hyperparathyroidism.
