  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cardiac rhythm disease usually of the elderly characterized by
      electrocardiographic findings of sinus bradycardia atrial fibrillation atrial
      tachycardia sinus arrest or sino-atrial block and that manifest with symptoms
      like syncope dizziness palpitations fatigue or even heart failure. It results
      from malfunction of the cardiac conduction system probably secondary to degenerative
      fibrosis of nodal tissue in the elderly or secondary to cardiac disorders in
      younger patients.
