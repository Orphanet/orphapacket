  Synonyms:
  - Synonym: Cherubism-gingival fibromatosis-intellectual disability syndrome
  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary bone dysplasia syndrome characterized by bilateral
      painless swelling of the face extending from the mandible to the inferior orbital
      margins (cherubism) epilepsy gingival fibromatosis (possibly obscuring teeth)
      and intellectual disability. Other associated variable features include hypertrichosis
      stunted growth juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and development of ocular abnormalities
      (e.g. pigmentary retinopathy optic disc pallor Axenfeld anomaly). Radiological
      images typically show bilateral multifocal radiolucency involving the body angle
      and ramus of the mandible and coronoid process.
