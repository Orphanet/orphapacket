    Contents: 'Schisis association describes the combination of two or more of the
      following anomalies: neural tube defects (e.g. anencephaly encephalocele spina
      bifida cystica) cleft lip/palate omphalocele and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
      These anomalies are associated at a higher frequency than would be expected
      with random combination rates.'
