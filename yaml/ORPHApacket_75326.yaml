  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral small vessel disease characterized by isolated
      marked tortuosity of second-order and third-order retinal arteries with normal
      first-order arteries and venous system typically located in the macular and
      peripapillary area and developing during childhood or early adulthood. The disease
      may be asymptomatic although most patients present variable degrees of transient
      vision loss due to retinal hemorrhage following physical exertion or minor trauma.
