  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by infantile-onset encephalomyopathy presenting with developmental delay slowly
      progressive hemiplegia intractable epileptic seizures and asymmetrical brain
      atrophy with dilatation of the ipsilateral ventricle system. Additional features
      include optic atrophy mildly increased plasma and/or CSF lactate and decreased
      cytochrome c oxidase activity in skeletal muscle biopsy.
