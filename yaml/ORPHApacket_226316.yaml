  TextSection:
    Contents: Genetic transient congenital hypothyroidism is a rare thyroid disease
      characterized by a gene mutation induced temporary deficiency of thyroid hormones
      at birth which later reverts to normal with or without replacement therapy in
      the first few months or years of life.
