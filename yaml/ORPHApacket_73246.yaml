  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by developmental delay neuropathic visceral dysmotility (resulting in neurogenic
      megacystis and sometimes chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome) intracerebral
      calcifications and dysmorphic facial features (including broad forehead downslanted
      palpebral fissures strabismus protruding and low-set ears and retrognathia).
      Microcephaly and renal abnormalities have also been reported.
