  TextSection:
    Contents: Dirofilariasis is a form of filariasis (see this term) caused by the
      filarial nematode of the genus <i>Dirofilaria</i> (including <i>Dirofilaria
      repens</i> <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i>) which is transmitted by mosquitoes. The
      disease is characterized by the presence of subcutaneous nodules (or a conjunctival
      form that develops slowly and that can be painless to tender) edema and erythema
      at the site of parasite localization a feeling of 'crawling' under the skin
      and the ''Calabar'' swelling (similar to thatin loiasis (see this term). The
      latter may last a few days and recurrences are possible. Common localizations
      of dirofilaria are head and neck most commonly in the periorbital region the
      limbs and trunk.
