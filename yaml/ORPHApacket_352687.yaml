  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital muscular alpha-dystroglycanopathy with brain and eye anomalies
      (MDDGA) is a cobblestone lissencephaly characterized by and considered to be
      pathognomonic of a continuum of recessive autosomal disorders with brain ocular
      and muscular involvement. MDDGA includes Walker-Warburg syndrome muscle-eye-brain
      disease Fukuyama muscular and cerebral dystrophy and muscle eye brain disease
      with bilateral multicystic leukodystrophy.
