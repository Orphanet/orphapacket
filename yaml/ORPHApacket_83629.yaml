  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by the association
      of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy with spondylometaphyseal dysplasia. Patients
      present in infancy with absent or delayed ability to walk independently slowly
      progressive motor deterioration spasticity ataxia proximal weakness and joint
      contractures. Additional manifestations include mild cognitive impairment short
      stature scoliosis enlarged and deformed joints dysarthria nystagmus visual defects
      and mildly dysmorphic features among others. Mode of inheritance is X-linked
      recessive.
