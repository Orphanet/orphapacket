  TextSection:
    Contents: Curry-Jones syndrome is a form of syndromic craniosynostosis characterized
      by unilateral coronal craniosynostosis or multiple suture synostosis associated
      with complete or partial agenesis of the corpus callosum preaxial polysyndactyly
      and syndactyly of hands and/or feet along with anomalies of the skin (characteristic
      pearly white areas that become scarred and atrophic abnormal hair growth around
      the eyes and/or cheeks and on the limbs) eyes (iris colobomas microphthalmia,)
      and intestine (congenital short gut malrotation dysmotility chronic constipation
      bleeding and myofibromas). Developmental delay and variable degrees of intellectual
      disability may also be observed. Multiple intra-abdominal smooth muscle hamartomas
      trichoblastoma of the skin occipital meningoceles and development of desmoplastic
      medulloblastoma have been reported.
