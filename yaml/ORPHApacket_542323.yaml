  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic condition affecting patients undergoing chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and characterized by a systemic inflammatory response
      due to massive activation of leukocytes with subsequent cytokine release. It
      can present with a variety of signs and symptoms ranging from mild flu-like
      symptoms (such as fever fatigue headache rash arthralgia and myalgia) to severe
      life-threatening manifestations including vascular leakage disseminated intravascular
      coagulation shock and multiple organ failure. Respiratory manifestations are
      common and range from cough and tachypnea to acute respiratory distress syndrome
      (ARDS).
