  TextSection:
    Contents: Renal-hepatic-pancreatic dysplasia is a rare genetic developmental defect
      during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by the triad of pancreatic fibrosis
      (and cysts with a reduction of parenchymal tissue) renal dysplasia (with peripheral
      cortical cysts primitive collecting ducts glomerular cysts and metaplastic cartilage)
      and hepatic dysgenesis (enlarged portal areas containing numerous elongated
      binary profiles with a tendancy to perilobular fibrosis). Situs abnormalities
      skeletal anomalies and anencephaly have also been associated. Patients that
      survive the neonatal period present renal insufficiency chronic jaundice and
      insulin-dependent diabetes.
