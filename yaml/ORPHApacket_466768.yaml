  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant hereditary axonal motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by early onset of generalized hypotonia and weakness or later
      onset of distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy cramps and sensory impairment.
      Weakness and atrophy progress in an asymmetric fashion to involve also the proximal
      and upper limbs in the course of the disease. Additional features are pyramidal
      signs like increased muscle tone and extensor plantar reflexes as well as learning
      difficulties.
