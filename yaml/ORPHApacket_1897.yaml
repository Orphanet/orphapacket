  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by the association
      of ectodermal dysplasia (with hypotrichosis affecting scalp hair eyebrows and
      eyelashes and partial anodontia) ectrodactyly and macular dystrophy (appearing
      as a central geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillary
      layer of the macular area with coarse hyperpigmentations and sparing of the
      larger choroidal vessels). Variable additional limb defects (including absence
      deformities polydactyly syndactyly or camptodactyly) have also been described
      the hands often being more severely affected than the feet.
