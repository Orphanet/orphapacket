  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary ciliary dyskinesia - retinitis pigmentosa is an X-linked ciliary
      dysfunction of both respiratory epithelium and photoreceptors of the retina
      leading to ocular disorders (mild night blindness constriction of the visual
      field and scotopic and photopic ERG responses reduced to 30-60%) associated
      with primary ciliary dyskinesia manifestations (chronic bronchorrhea with bronchiectasis
      and chronic sinusitis) and sensorineural hearing loss.
