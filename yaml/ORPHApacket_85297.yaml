  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a form of spinocerebellar
      degeneration characterized by onset in infancy of hypotonia ataxia sensorineural
      deafness developmental delay esotropia and optic atrophy and by a progressive
      course leading to death in childhood. It has been described in one family with
      at least six affected males from five different sibships (connected through
      carrier females). It is transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait.
