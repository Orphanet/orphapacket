  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterised by a slowly progressive pure cerebellar
      ataxia associated with dysarthria. It has been described in 53 individuals from
      26 families of Canadian origin. The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive.
      Positional cloning has led to the identification of several <i<SYNE1</i> gene
      mutations.
