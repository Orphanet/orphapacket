    Contents: A rare oblique facial cleft characterized by a defect between the maxilla
      and the zygomatic bone opening into the infra-orbital fissure accompanied by
      coloboma of the lower eyelid and a vertical furrow on the cheek oriented either
      laterally to the corner of the mouth or in the direction of the angle of the
      mandible. The posterior aspect of the maxilla is short with a high palate and
      choanal atresia. The malformation is typically associated with Treacher-Collins
