  TextSection:
    Contents: Deafness-oligodontia syndrome is characterised by sensorineural hearing
      loss and oligodontia/hypodontia. It has been described in two pairs of siblings
      and in one isolated case. Dizziness was reported in one of the pairs of siblings.
      Transmission appears to be autosomal recessive.
