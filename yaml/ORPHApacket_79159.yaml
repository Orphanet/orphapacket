  TextSection:
    Contents: Isobutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is an inborn error of valine
      metabolism. The prevalence is unknown. Only one symptomatic patient (with anaemia
      failure to thrive dilated cardiomyopathy and plasma carnitine deficiency) has
      been described so far but several series of patients have been identified through
      newborn screening programs relying on detection of increased C(4)-carnitine
      levels by tandem mass spectrometry. The disorder is caused by mutations in the
      <i>ACAD8</i> gene (11q25).
