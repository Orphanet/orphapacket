  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC) is a hereditary liver
      disorder characterized by intermittent episodes of intrahepatic cholestasis
      generally without progression to chronic liver damage. BRIC is now believed
      to belong to a clinical spectrum of intrahepatic cholestatic disorders that
      ranges from the mild intermittent attacks in BRIC to the severe chronic and
      progressive cholestasis seen in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis
      (PFIC; see this term).
