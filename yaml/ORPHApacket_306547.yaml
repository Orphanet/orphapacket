  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic central nervous system malformation syndrome characterized
      by bilateral congenital cataracts and severe hemorrhagic destruction of the
      brain parenchyma with associated massive cystic degeneration enlarged ventricles
      and subependymal calcification. Patients typically present generalized spasticity
      increased deep tendon reflexes and seizures. Hepatomegaly and renal anomalies
      have also been reported.
