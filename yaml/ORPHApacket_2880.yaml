  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare gluconeogenesis disorder that results from impairment in the
      enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and comprised of cytosolic and mitochondrial
      forms of enzyme deficiency. Onset of symptoms is neonatal or a few months after
      birth and includes hypoglycemia associated with acute episodes of severe lactic
      acidosis progressive neurological deterioration severe liver failure renal tubular
      acidosis and Fanconi syndrome. Patients also present progressive multisystem
      damage with failure to thrive muscular weakness and hypotonia developmental
      delay with seizures spasticity lethargy microcephaly and cardiomyopathy. To
      date there is no conclusive evidence of the existence of an isolated form of
      this disorder.
