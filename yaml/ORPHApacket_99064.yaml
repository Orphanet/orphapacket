  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      an abnormal attachment of the mitral chordae to both ventricles. Straddling
      mitral valve is usually associated with conotruncal anomalies most commonly
      double outlet right ventricle or transposition of the great arteries. Overriding
      mitral valve is characterized by a mitral annulus committed to the two ventricular
      chambers where the mitral valve is shared between the ventricles. Straddling
      and overriding mitral valve can occur together or in isolation.
