  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant hereditary axonal motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by predominantly distal weakness and muscle atrophy decreased
      or absent tendon reflexes and reduced vibratory sensation in the lower and upper
      extremities. Pes cavus develops in many patients. Additional symptoms like ataxia
      tremor or swallowing difficulties have been reported. Patients usually remain
      ambulatory even late in the disease. Age of onset ranges from childhood to adulthood
      with earlier onset tending to be associated with a more severe disease phenotype.
