  TextSection:
    Contents: Humero-radio-ulnar synostosis is an extremely rare genetic congenital
      joint formation defect disorder characterized by uni- or bilateral fusion of
      the humerus radius and ulnar bones leading to loss of elbow motion and in most
      functional arm incapacity. It may appear as distal humeral bifurcation with
      absent elbow joint and shortened arm length on imaging. Hand abnormalities namely
      oligoectrosyndactyly may be associated.
