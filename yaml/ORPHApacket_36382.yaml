  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial cervical artery dissection is a rare genetic neurological disorder
      characterized by dissection of the cervical artery in various members of a single
      family presenting with variable manifestations which range from asymptomatic
      to the triad of ipsilateral pain in the head neck and face Horner syndrome and
      cerebral or retinal ischemic symptoms. Headache and cerebral ischemic features
      are most frequently observed.
