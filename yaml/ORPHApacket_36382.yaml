    Contents: Familial cervical artery dissection is a rare genetic neurological disorder
      characterized by dissection of the cervical artery in various members of a single
      family presenting with variable manifestations which range from asymptomatic

      cerebral or retinal ischemic symptoms. Headache and cerebral ischemic features
      are most frequently observed.
