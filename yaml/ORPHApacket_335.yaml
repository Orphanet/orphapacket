  TextSection:
    Contents: Rare inherited coagulation disorders characterized by bleeding symptoms
      ranging from mild to severe resulting from reduced quantity and/or quality of
      circulating fibrinogen. Afibrinogenemia (complete absence of fibrinogen) and
      hypofibrinogenemia (reduced plasma fibrinogen concentration) correspond to quantitative
      anomalies of fibrinogen while dysfibrinogenemia corresponds to a functional
      anomaly of fibrinogen. Hypo- and dysfibrinogenemia may be frequently combined
      (hypodysfibrinogenemia).
