  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature due to growth hormone qualitative anomaly is characterised
      by growth retardation and short stature (despite the presence of normal or slightly
      elevated levels of immunoreactive growth hormone GH) low concentrations of insulin-like
      growth factor-I (IGF-I) and a significant increase in growth rate following
      recombinant GH therapy. Prevalence is unknown but only a few cases have been
      reported in the literature. The syndrome is caused by various mutations in the
      <i>GH1</i> gene (17q22-q24) that result in structural GH anomalies and a biologically
      inactive molecule. Transmission is autosomal recessive.
