  TextSection:
    Contents: A number of families have been described where several members were
      affected with coarctation of aorta. In a systematic study of coarctation familial
      aggregation was considered as result of multifactorial inheritance and recurrence
      risks in sibs was evaluated at about 0.5% for coarctation and 1.0% for any form
      of congenital heart defect. Nevertheless in some of the described families aortic
      coarctations seems to be inherited as an autosomal dominant mutation.
