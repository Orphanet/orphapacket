    Contents: A rare spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia
      characterized by short stature vertebral abnormalities (including irregular
      vertebral endplates especially in the dorsal spine lumbar lordosis spondylolysis
      spondylolisthesis) femoral abnormalities (including small femoral capital epiphyses
      flat femoral head and subluxation and sloping acetabulum) and cervical spine

      associated with os odontoideum. Affected individuals present with severe neurological

      brisk reflexes clonus spasticity bulbar palsy and seizures. Additional clinical
