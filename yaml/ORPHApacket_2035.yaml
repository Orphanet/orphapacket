  TextSection:
    Contents: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a severe form of filariasis caused by the
      parasitic worms <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i> <i>Brugia malayi</i> and <i>Brugia
      timori</i> and the most common cause of acquired lymphedema worldwide. LF is
      endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. The vast majority of infected patients
      are asymptomatic but it can also cause a variety of clinical manifestations
      including limb lymphedema genital anomalies (hydrocele chylocele) elephantiasis
      in later stages of the disease (frequently in the lower extremities) and tropical
      pulmonary eosinophilia (nocturnal paroxysmal cough and wheezing weight loss
      low-grade fever adenopathy and pronounced blood eosinophilia). Renal involvement
      (hematuria proteinuria nephritic syndrome glomerulonephritis) and mono-arthritis
      of the knee or ankle joint have also been reported.
