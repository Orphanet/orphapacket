  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive acromesomelic dysplasia characterized by
      severe dwarfism (adult height approximately 120 cm) with abnormalities limited
      to the limbs (affecting the lower limbs more than upper limbs with middle and
      distal segments being the most affected) severe shortening absence or fusion
      of tubular bones of hands and feet and large joint dislocations. As seen in
      acromesomelic dysplasia Grebe type and acromesomelic dysplasia Maroteaux type
      facial features and intelligence are normal.
