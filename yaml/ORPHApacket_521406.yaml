  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of manganese transport characterized by progressive
      movement disorder and elevated blood manganese levels. Patients present in infancy
      or early childhood with loss of motor milestones rapidly progressive dystonia
      spasticity bulbar dysfunction and parkinsonism resulting in loss of independent
      ambulation. Cognition may be impaired but is generally better preserved than
      motor function. Additional manifestations include abnormal head growth and skull
      deformities. Brain MRI shows abnormalities of the basal ganglia variably also
      of other brain regions.
