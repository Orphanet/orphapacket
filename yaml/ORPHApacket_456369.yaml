  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare glycogen storage disease characterized by slowly progressive
      myopathy with storage of polyglucosan in muscle fibers. Age of onset ranges
      from childhood to late adulthood. Patients present proximal or proximodistal
      weakness predominantly of limb-girdle muscles. Variable features include exercise
      intolerance or myalgia. Serum creatine kinase is normal or mildly elevated.
      There is usually no overt cardiac involvement.
