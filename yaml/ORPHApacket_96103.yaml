  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal trisomy 11q is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 11 with high phenotypic
      variability principally characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism (brachycephaly/plagiocephaly
      low-set posteriorly rotated ears short philtrum micrognathia) and intellectual
      disability. Short stature and seizures as well as cardiac (e.g. atrial septal
      defect) skeletal (incl. brachy/syndactyly) and genital (e.g. micropenis cryptorchidism)
      abnormalities may also be associated. Neurodevelopmental anomalies (pain insensitivity
      sensorineural hearing loss expressive language deficiency) and neuropsychiatric
      disorders (autistic features auditory hallucination self-talking) have also
      been reported.
