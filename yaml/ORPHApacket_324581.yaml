  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign Samaritan congenital myopathy is a rare genetic skeletal muscle
      disease characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia with respiratory insufficiency
      delay in motor milestones and dysmorphic features including bitemporal narrowing
      epicanthal folds and hypertelorism. Affected individuals show gradual improvement
      in hypotonia and muscle weakness within the first two years of life resulting
      in minimal clinical manifestations in adulthood.
