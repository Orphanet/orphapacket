  TextSection:
    Contents: Generalized epilepsy-paroxysmal dyskinesia syndrome is characterised
      by the association of paroxysmal dyskinesia and generalised epilepsy (usually
      absence or generalised tonic-clonic seizures) in the same individual or family.
      The prevalence is unknown. Analysis in one of the reported families led to the
      identification of a causative mutation in the <i>KCNMA1</i> gene (chromosome
      10q22) encoding the alpha subunit of the BK channel. Transmission is autosomal
      dominant.
