  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized
      by total mirror-image transposition of both thoracic and abdominal viscera across
      the left-right axis of the body. Congenital abnormalities such as primary ciliary
      dyskinesia Kartagener type polysplenia syndrome biliary atresia congenital heart
      disease and midgut malrotation as well as vascular anomalies (e.g. absence of
      retrohepatic inferior vena cava preduodenal portal vein aberrant hepatic arterial
      anatomy) and malignancy are frequently associated.
