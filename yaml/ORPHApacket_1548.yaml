  TextSection:
    Contents: Cryptorchidism-arachnodactyly-intellectual disability syndrome is a
      rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by psychomotor delay
      severe intellectual deficit severe muscle hypoplasia (with absence of subcutaneous
      fatty tissue) generalized contractures craniofacial dysmorphic features (dolichocephaly
      esotropia ears of unequal size high palate) chest and spinal deformities (i.e.
      sternum shifted to side kyphoscoliosis) pulmonary anomalies (unilateral hypoplastic
      bronchial system) arachnodactyly and genital abnormalities (cryptorchidism hypospadias
      testicular agenesis). Repeated respiratory tract infections and atelectasis
      are also associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1970.
