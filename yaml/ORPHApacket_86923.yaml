  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary palmoplantar keratoderma Gamborg-Nielsen type is characterised
      by the presence of diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma without associated symptoms.
      The syndrome has been described in multiple families from the northernmost county
      of Sweden (Norrbotten). The palmoplantar keratoderma found in the Gamborg-Nielsen
      type disease is milder than that found in Mal de Meleda but more severe than
      that found in Thost-Unna palmoplantar keratoderma (see these terms). Transmission
      is autosomal recessive.
