  TextSection:
    Contents: Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome (KSS) is the mildest form of hypoxanthine-guanine
      phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency (see this term) a hereditary disorder
      of purine metabolism and is associated with uric acid overproduction (UAO) leading
      to urolithiasis and early-onset gout.
