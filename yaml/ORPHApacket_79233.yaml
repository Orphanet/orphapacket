  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency
      characterized by uric acid overproduction leading to urolithiasis and early-onset
      gout and a continuum spectrum of neurological manifestations depending on the
      degree of the enzyme deficiency without self-injurious behavior.
