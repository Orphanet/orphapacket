    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngologic disease characterized by recurrent and severe
      obstruction of the central airway in the region bounded superiorly by a plane
      below the glottis and inferiorly by the first two tracheal rings. Symptoms may
      involve respiratory distress dysphonia exertional dyspnea stridor chronic cough
      and wheezing. Diagnosis is challenging due to the lack of apparent etiology
      and nonspecific respiratory symptoms that can be confounded with other common
      respiratory diseases and may also occur in late course of the disease. Thorough
      clinical and laboratory evaluation aims to exclude other causes of subglottic
      stenosis is therefore essential. Affected patients are almost exclusively Caucasian
      women between 30-60&nbsp;years old.
