  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) characterized by a spectrum
      of hypopigmentation of skin hair and eyes ranging from little or no pigmentation
      to localized pigementation. Nystagmus photophobia and reduced visual acuity
      are frequently present. The subtypes include OCA1A OCA1B type 1 minimal pigment
      oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1-MP) and type 1 temperature sensitive oculocutaneous
      albinism (OCA1-TS).
