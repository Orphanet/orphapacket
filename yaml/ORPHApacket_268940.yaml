  TextSection:
    Contents: Bilateral polymicrogyria is a rare cerebral malformation due to abnormal
      neuronal migration defined as a cerebral cortex with many excessively small
      convolutions. It presents with developmental delay intellectual disability seizures
      and various neurological impairments and may be isolated or comprise a clinical
      feature of many genetic syndromes. It may also be associated with perinatal
      cytomegalovirus infection.
