  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare defect of tropomyosin characterized by decreased fetal movements
      and generalized muscle stiffness at birth. Additional features include joint
      contractures short stature kyphosis dysmorphic features temperature dysregulation
      and variably severe respiratory involvement with hypoxemia. Muscle biopsy shows
      mild myopathic features.
