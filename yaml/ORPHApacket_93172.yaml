  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of renal dysplasia (RD) characterized by abnormal or incomplete
      development of one kidney. Unilateral RD can be segmental and of variable severity
      with renal aplasia corresponding to extreme RD. Patients may be asymptomatic
      if the contralateral kidney is functional. Even in cases of severe unilateral
      RD i.e. renal aplasia the risk of renal failure in childhood is minimal; however
      patients may develop hypertension proteinuria and renal failure as adults.
