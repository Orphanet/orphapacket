  TextSection:
    Contents: German syndrome is an autosomal recessive arthrogryposis syndrome described
      in 5 cases. Three of the four known families with affected children were Ashkenazi
      Jews. German syndrome is characterized by arthrogryposis hypotonia-hypokinesia
      sequence and lymphedema. Patients present distinct craniofacial appearance (tall
      forehead and ''carp''-shaped mouth cleft palate) contractures severe hypotonia
      manifesting as motor delay and swallowing difficulties. The disease has a severe
      morbidity and mortality rate and survivors present a small stature hypotonia
      frequent upper respiratory infections and psychomotor delay. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1987.
