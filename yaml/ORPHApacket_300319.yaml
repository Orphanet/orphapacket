  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2P is a rare genetic axonal hereditary
      motor and sensory neuropathy disorder characterized by adulthood-onset of slowly
      progressive occasionally asymmetrical distal muscle weakness and atrophy (predominantly
      in the lower limbs) pan-modal sensory loss muscle cramping in extremities and/or
      trunk pes cavus and absent or reduced deep tendon reflexes. Gait anomalies and
      variable autonomic disturbances such as erectile dysfunction and urinary urgency
      may be associated.
