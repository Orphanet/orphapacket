  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia typically

      phenotype of lower limb spasticity with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses
      as well as mild bladder disturbances and <i>pes cavus</i>. Rarely it can present
      as a complex phenotype with additional manifestations including epilepsy variable
      peripheral neuropathy and/or memory impairment.
