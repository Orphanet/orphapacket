  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by costovertebral ossification
      defects with small chest abnormal vertebral segmentation and posterior rib gaps
      containing incompletely differentiated mesenchymal tissue. Consistent dysmorphic
      craniofacial features include ocular hypertelorism epicanthal folds depressed
      nasal bridge with short nose and low-set ears. The most common extraosseous
      manifestations are renal abnormalities such as multicystic kidneys. The disease
      is usually perinatally lethal due to respiratory insufficiency.
