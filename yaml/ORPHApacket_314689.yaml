    Contents: A rare genetic combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized
      by T- and B-cell lymphopenia hypergammaglobulinemia and intermittent neutropenia.
      It presents with recurrent opportunistic viral bacterial and fungal infections
      involving skin (cutaneous papillomatosis molluscum contagiosum skin abscesses
      mucocutaneous candidiasis) upper and lower respiratory tract or septicemia.
