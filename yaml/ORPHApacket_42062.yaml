  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevated levels of
      imino acids (proline hydroxyproline) and glycine in urine due to defective reabsorption
      in the kidney. The condition is considered benign and not associated with any
      specific clinical phenotype. Mode of inheritance is autosomal recessive.
