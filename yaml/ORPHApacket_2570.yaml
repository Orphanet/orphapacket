  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare and fatal central nervous system malformation occurring during
      embryogenesis presenting prenatally with holoprosencephaly and fetal hypokinesia
      as major features. Other manifestations include microcephaly multiple contractures
      and intrauterine growth restriction. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1988.
