  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH) is a rare genetic bone disorder
      characterized clinically by progressive extraskeletal bone formation presenting
      in early life with cutaneous ossification that progressively involves subcutaneous
      and then subsequently deep connective tissues including muscle and fascia. POH
      overlaps with a number of related genetic disorders including Albright hereditary
      osteodystrophy pseudohypoparathyroidism (see these terms) and primary osteoma
      cutis that share the common features of superficial heterotopic ossification
      in association with inactivating mutations of <i>GNAS</i> gene (20q13.2-q13.3)
      coding for guanine nucleotide-binding proteins. POH can however be distinguished
      clinically by the deep and progressive nature of the heterotopic bone formation.
