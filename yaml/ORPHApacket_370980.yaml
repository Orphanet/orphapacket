  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic congenital muscular dystrophy due to dystroglycanopathy
      characterized by a wide phenotypic spectrum which includes hypotonia and muscular
      weakness present at birth or early infancy delayed or arrested motor development
      and normal intellectual abilities with normal (or only mild abnormalities) neuroimaging
      studies. Feeding difficulties joint and spinal deformities and respiratory insufficiency
      may be associated. Decreased alpha-dystroglycan on immunohistochemical muscle
      staining and elevated serum creatine kinase are observed.
