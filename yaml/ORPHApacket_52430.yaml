  TextSection:
    Contents: Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal
      dementia (IBMPFD) is a multisystem degenerative genetic disorder characterized
      by adult-onset proximal and distal muscle weakness (clinically resembling limb-girdle
      muscular dystrophy; see this term); early-onset Paget disease of bone (see this
      term) manifesting with bone pain deformity and enlargement of the long-bones;
      and premature frontotemporal dementia (see this term) manifesting first with
      dysnomia dyscalculia and comprehension deficits followed by progressive aphasia
      alexia and agraphia. As the disease progresses muscle weakness begins to affect
      the other limbs and respiratory muscles ultimately resulting in respiratory
      or cardiac failure.
