  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephaly-cervical spine fusion anomalies syndrome is characterized
      by microcephaly facial dysmorphism (beaked nose low-set ears downslanting palpebral
      fissures micrognathia) mild intellectual deficit short stature and cervical
      spine fusion anomalies producing spinal cord compression. It has been described
      in two brothers born to consanguineous parents. Transmission is likely to be
      autosomal recessive.
