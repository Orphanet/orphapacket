  TextSection:
    Contents: Tetramelic monodactyly is a rare genetic congenital limb malformation
      disorder characterized by the presence of a single digit on all four extremities.
      Malformation is typically isolated however aplastic and hypoplastic defects
      in the remaining skeletal parts of hands and feet have been reported. There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1992.
