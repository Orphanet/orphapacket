    Contents: Developmental and speech delay due to SOX5 deficiency is a rare genetic
      syndromic intellectual disability characterized by mild to severe global developmental
      delay intellectual disability and behavioral abnormalities hypotonia strabismus
      optic nerve hypoplasia and mild facial dysmorphic features (down slanting palpebral
      fissures frontal bossing crowded teeth auricular abnormalities and prominent
      philtral ridges). Other associated clinical features may include seizures and
