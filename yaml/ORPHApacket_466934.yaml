  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic leukodystrophy identified in families of Ashkenazi Jewish
      descent characterized by infancy onset of severe global developmental delay
      with very limited or absent speech and sometimes complete absence of motor development
      hypotonia spasticity and acquired microcephaly. Seizures hearing loss visual
      impairment and autonomic dysfunction have also been described. Brain imaging
      shows delayed myelination and other white matter abnormalities.
