  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital cataract-progressive muscular hypotonia-hearing loss-developmental
      delay syndrome is a rare genetic mitochondrial myopathy disorder characterized
      by congenital cataract progressive muscular hypotonia that particularly affects
      the lower limbs reduced deep tendon reflexes sensorineural hearing loss global
      development delay and lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy reveals reduced complex
      I II and IV respiratory chain activity.
