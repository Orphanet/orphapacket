  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by age of onset between 50-66 years of age memory impairment myoclonic jerks
      expressive dysphagia short-stepped gait personality changes and lobar intracerebral
      hemorrhages. This subtype is due to a mutation in the <i>APP</i> gene (21q21.2)
      encoding the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This mutation causes an increased
      accumulation of amyloid-beta protein in the walls of the arteries and capillaries
      of the meninges cerebellar cortex and cerebral cortex leading to the weakening
      and eventual rupture of these vessels.
