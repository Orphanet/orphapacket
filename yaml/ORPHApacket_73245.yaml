  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by bilateral cataract Dandy-Walker
      malformation and childhood onset of distal spinal muscular atrophy. Patients
      present with progressively deteriorating symmetrical distal muscle weakness
      and atrophy of the lower limbs (and to a much lesser degree also the upper limbs)
      and decreased tendon reflexes in the lower and upper limbs.
