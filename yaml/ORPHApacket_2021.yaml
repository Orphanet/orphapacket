  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare rhizo-mesomelic dysplasia characterized by distinct facial features
      (flat midface flat small nose anteverted nares low set ears protuberant eyes
      and small mouth with long upper lip) markedly short limbs with relatively normal
      hands and feet short ribs with broad metaphyses and small bell-shaped thorax
      with protuberant abdomen. Vertebral bodies are flat creating a distinctive pinched
      appearance in lateral radiographic views. Cleft palate micrognathia bifid tongue
      and brachyclinodactyly with some soft tissue syndactyly have been reported in
      few patients. It is mostly a neonatally lethal condition. Affected individuals
      who survive the neonatal period persents with severe global developmental delay
      severe skeletal dysplasia high myopia and mild to moderate hearing loss.
