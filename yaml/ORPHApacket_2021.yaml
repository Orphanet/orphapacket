    Contents: Fibrochondrogenesis is a rare neonatally lethal rhizomelic chondrodysplasia.
      Eleven cases have been reported. The face is distinctive and characterized by
      protuberant eyes flat midface flat small nose with anteverted nares and a small
      mouth with long upper lip. Cleft palate micrognathia and bifid tongue can occur.
      The limbs show marked shortness of all segments with relatively normal hands
      and feet. No internal anomalies other than omphalocele have been reported. Transmission
      is probably autosomal recessive. Recurrence in a consanguineous family (affecting
      both sexes) and concordance of affected male twins have been reported.
