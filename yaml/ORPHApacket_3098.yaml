  TextSection:
    Contents: Rhizomelic syndrome Urbach type is a rare primary bone dysplasia characterized
      by upper limbs rhizomelia and other skeletal anomalies (e.g. short stature dislocated
      hips digitalization of the thumb with bifid distal phalanx) craniofacial features
      (e.g. microcephaly large anterior fontanelle fine and sparse scalp hair depressed
      nasal bridge high arched palate micrognathia short neck) congenital heart defects
      (e.g. pulmonary stenosis) delayed psychomotor development and mild flexion contractures
      of elbows. Radiologic evaluation may reveal flared epiphyses platyspondyly and/or
      digital anomalies.
