  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by upper limbs rhizomelia
      and other skeletal anomalies including short stature dislocated hips and bifid
      distal phalanx of the thumb. Craniofacial features include microcephaly large
      anterior fontanelle fine and sparse scalp hair depressed nasal bridge high arched
      palate micrognathia and short neck. Pulmonary stenosis delayed psychomotor development
      and mild flexion contractures of the elbows have also been reported. There have
      been no further descriptions in the literature since 1987.
