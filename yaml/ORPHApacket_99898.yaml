  TextSection:
    Contents: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete
      interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) deficiency is a genetic variant of
      MSMD characterized by a complete deficiency in IFN-gammaR1 leading to impaired
      IFN-gamma immunity and consequently to severe and often fatal infections with
      bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria (EM).
