  TextSection:
    Contents: "Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete\
      \ interferon gamma receptor 1 (IFN-gammaR1) deficiency is a genetic variant\
      \ of MSMD (see this term) characterized by a complete deficiency in IFN-gammaR1\
      \ leading to impaired IFN-gamma immunity and consequently to severe and often\
      \ fatal infections with bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) and other environmental\
      \ mycobacteria (EM)."
