  TextSection:
    Contents: Pinnae fistula or cyst is a rare otorhinolaryngological malformation
      characterized by the presence of a usually unilateral sinus tract or cyst located
      in the vicinity of the auricle (most frequently identified by a small pit near
      the anterior margin of the first ascending portion of the helix). Typically
      patients are asymptomatic and usually only present symptoms (pain erythema discharge
      from pit) in relation to infection. Renal and inner ear anomalies may be associated.
