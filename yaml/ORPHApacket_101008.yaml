  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 28 is a pure form of hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by a childhood or adolescent onset of slowly
      progressive pure crural muscle spastic paraparesis which manifests with mild
      lower limb weakness gait difficulties extensor plantar responses and hyperreflexia
      of lower extremities. Less common manifestations include cerebellar oculomotor
      disturbance with saccadic eye pursuit pes cavus and scoliosis. Some patients
      also present pin and vibration sensory loss in distal legs.
