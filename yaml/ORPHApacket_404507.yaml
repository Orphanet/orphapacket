  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bone tumor characterized by a benign lesion composed of lobules
      of spindle shaped or stellate cells and an abundant myxoid or chondroid matrix.
      The tumor may occur in almost any osseous location but is most common in long
      bones in particular the proximal tibia and the distal femur. Pain is the most
      common presenting symptom. Prognosis is excellent even in cases with local recurrence.
