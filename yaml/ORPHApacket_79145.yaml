  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hyperpigmentation of the skin disease characterized by
      adulthood-onset of reticular reddish-brown to dark-brown macular and/or comedone-like
      hyperkeratotic papules with hypopigmented macules predominantly affecting flexural
      areas and on occasion progressing to involve trunk and acral regions. Histologically
      epidermal acanthosis thin branch-like rete ridges and a tendency for acantholysis
      and pigmentary incontinence is observed.
