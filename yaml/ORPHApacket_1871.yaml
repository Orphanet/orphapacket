  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare retinal dystrophy characterized by photophobia progressive loss
      of visual acuity nystagmus visual field abnormalities abnormal color vision
      and psychophysical and electrophysiological evidence of abnormal cone function.
      Progressive cone dystrophy usually presents in childhood or early adult life
      and patients tend to develop rod photoreceptor dysfunction in later life.
