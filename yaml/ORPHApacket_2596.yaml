    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial DNA-related mitochondrial myopathy disorder
      characterized by slowly progressive muscular weakness (proximal greater than
      distal) predominantly involving the facial muscles and scapular girdle associated
      with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Neurological involvement and congenital
      myopathy may be variably observed.
