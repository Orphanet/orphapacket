    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 17 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable clinical presentation mostly characterized by growth delay intellectual
      disability body asymmetry with leg length differentiation scoliosis and congenital
      heart anomalies (e.g. ventricular septal defect). Prenatal ultrasound findings
      include intrauterine growth retardation nuchal thickening brain anomalies (e.g.
      cerebellar hypoplasia) pleural effusion and single umbilical artery. Patients
      with no associated malformations have also been reported.
