  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary organ-specific lymphoma characterized by primary origin
      in the thyroid gland sometimes involving cervical lymph nodes and infrequently
      more distant sites. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is most common followed by
      MALT lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. More rare types include T-cell lymphomas
      Burkitt lymphoma or classic Hodgkin lymphoma. The condition is usually associated
      with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Patients typically present with a mass in the thyroid
      with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Hoarseness and dyspnea may occur while
      constitutional symptoms are rare. Prognosis is favorable for patients with localized
      tumors.
