  TextSection:
    Contents: Kagami-Ogata syndrome is a rare genetic disease characterized by polyhydramnios
      (mostly due to placentomegaly) fetal macrosomia abdominal wall defects skeletal
      abnormalities (including bell-shaped thorax coat-hanger appearance of the ribs
      and decreased mid to wide thorax diameter ratio in infancy) feeding difficulties
      and impaired swallowing dysmorphic features (hairy forehead full cheeks protruding
      philtrum micrognathia) developmental delay and intellectual disability. Additional
      features may include kyphoskoliosis joint contractures diastasis recti muscular
      hypotonia. There is increased risk of hepatoblastoma.
