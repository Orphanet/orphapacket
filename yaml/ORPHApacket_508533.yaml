  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by the association of developmental delay variable intellectual disability skeletal
      dysplasia and in many cases T-cell immunodeficiency and other immunologic abnormalities.
      Skeletal findings include short stature anomalies of the long bones hands and
      feet and pelvis platyspondyly cervical malformation and pectus excavatum. Dysmorphic
      facial features such as coarse face hypertelorism and broad nasal tip may be
      present. Additional reported manifestations are seizures hyperreflexia nystagmus
      and muscular hypotonia as well as multiple liver cysts.
