  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy usually characterized by mild microcytic
      hemolysis and very rarely vaso-occlusive complications. Severe manifestations
      have been reported including hematuria splenic infarction acute chest syndrome
      acute episodes of pain and reversible bone marrow necrosis. The genotype is
      characterized by an HbS allele in combination with an HbE variant (beta26glu>lys);
      symptoms are due to the low allelic expression of HbE leading to HbS predominance
      (65+/-5%).
