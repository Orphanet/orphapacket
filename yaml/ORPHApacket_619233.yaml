    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by global developmental delay moderate to severe intellectual disability language
      delay and asympthomatic persistance of fetal hemoglobin. Joint laxity and microcephaly
      are commonly observed. Majority of the patients present with variable dysmorphic
      features (including strabismus downslanting palpebral fissures anteverted nose
      with small nares and full tip external ear anomalies thin upper lip and everted
      lower lip). Behavior problems including anxiety recurrent hand flapping/biting
