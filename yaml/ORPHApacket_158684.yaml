  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited epidermolysis bullosa simplex characterized by generalized
      severe blistering with widespread congenital absence of skin and pyloric atresia
      that is usually fatal in infancy. Antenatally pyloric atresia can manifest with
      polyhydramnios. If patients survive they experience life-long skin fragility
      and nail dystrophy. Additional extracutaneous findings include failure to thrive
      anemia sepsis intraoral blistering enamel hypoplasia urethral stenosis and urologic
      complications.
