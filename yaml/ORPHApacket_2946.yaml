      heart-hand syndrome (see this term) that is characterized by bisymmetric brachydactyly
      accompanied by long thumbs joint anomalies (restriction of motion at the shoulder
      and metacarpophalangeal joints) and cardiac conduction defects. Additional features
      include small hands and feet clinodactyly narrow shoulders with short clavicles
      pectus excavatum and mild shortness of the limbs cardiomegaly and murmur of
      pulmonic stenosis.It has been described in four family members from three generations
