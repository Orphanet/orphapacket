  TextSection:
    Contents: 12q15q21.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 12 with a highly
      variable phenotype typically characterized by developmental delay learning disability
      intra-uterine and postnatal growth retardation and mild facial dysmorphism that
      changes with age. Nasal speech and hypothyroidism are also associated.
