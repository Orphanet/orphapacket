  TextSection:
    Contents: Growth delay due to IGF-I resistance is characterised by variable intrauterine
      and postnatal growth retardation and elevated serum IGF-I levels. Addition features
      include variable degrees of intellectual deficit microcephaly and dysmorphism
      (broad nasal bridge and tip smooth philtrum thin upper and everted lower lips
      short fingers clinodactyly wide-set nipples and pectus excavatum).
