  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperkeratosis-hyperpigmentation syndrome describes a very rare hyperpigmentation
      of the skin characterized by tiny hyperpigmented spots mainly on skin exposed
      to sunlight together with mild punctate palmoplantar papular hyperkeratosis
      as a major feature. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1993.
