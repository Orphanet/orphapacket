  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of rare dysplastic cortical hyperostosis characterized by narrow
      chest short limbs with generalized symmetrical cortical thickening throughout
      the skeleton particularly in the long bones and ribs. Additional features may
      include sclerotic metacarpals and metatarsals with proximal tapering and mild
      sclerosis of the pelvis. No cortical thickening reported in skull or mandible.
      Size of the hands and feet are normal. Microcephaly abnormal lung segmentation
      hepatosplenomegaly poorly developed cerebral sulci and complete renal duplication
      has been observed. It is a lethal condition associated to severe fetal hydrops
      and polyhydramnios.
