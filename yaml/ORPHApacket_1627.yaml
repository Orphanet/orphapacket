  TextSection:
    Contents: Deletion 5q35 refers to the different congenital malformation syndromes
      resulting from deletions of variable extent of the terminal part of the long
      arm of chromosome 5 (5q) spanning the region from 5q35.1 to 5q35.3 . The most
      significant anomaly is a recurring deletion in 5q35.2 comprising the <i>NSD1</i>
      gene that causes Sotos syndrome that is characterized by cardinal features including
      excessive growth during childhood macrocephaly distinctive facial gestalt and
      various degrees of learning difficulty. Subtelomeric deletions of the terminal
      3.5 Mb region on 5q35.3 are very rare characterized by prenatal lymphedema with
      increased nuchal translucency pronounced muscular hypotonia in infancy borderline
      intelligence postnatal short stature due to growth hormone deficiency and a
      variety of minor anomalies such as mildly bell-shaped chest minor congenital
      heart defects and a distinct facial gestalt. Larger deletions including bands
      5q35.1 5q35.2 and 5q35.3 cause a more severe phenotype that associates severe
      developmental delay with microcephaly and significant cardiac defects (e.g.
      atrial septal defect with/without atrioventricular conduction defects Ebstein
      anomaly tetralogy of Fallot) linked to haploinsufficiency of <i>NKX2.5</i> (5q35.1).
      Various combinations of signs may result from deletions of variable extent depending
      on the genes comprised in the deleted segment.
