  TextSection:
    Contents: 3q13 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from a partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 3. Phenotype can be highly
      variable but it is primarily characterized by significant developmental delay
      postnatal growth above the mean muscular hypotonia and distinctive facial features
      (such as broad and prominent forehead hypertelorism epicanthic folds anti-mongloid
      slanted eyes ptosis short philtrum protruding lips with a full lower lip high
      arched palate). Abnormal hypoplastic male genitalia and skeletal abnormalities
      are frequently present.
