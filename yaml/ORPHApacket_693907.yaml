    Contents: A rare capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation characterized
      by single or multiple cutaneous lesions ranging from round to oval shape with
      pinkish to purplish-red or reddish-brown macules randomly distributed over the
      body. Perilesional pale halo are usually detected on the skin. These lesions
      may occur with or without arteriovenous malformations/arteriovenous fistulas
      involving muscle bone spine and brain. Parkes Weber syndrome with segmental
      distribution may also be present. Most patients are asymptomatic except for
      the capillary malformations the family history is often positive for capillary
      malformations.
