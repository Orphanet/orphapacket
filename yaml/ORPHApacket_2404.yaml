    Contents: Loiasis is a form of filariasis (see this term) caused by the parasitic
      worm <i>Loa loa</i> endemic to the forest and savannah regions of Central and
      Western Africa. Loiasis may either be asymptomatic or manifest as a large transient
      area of localized non-erythematous subcutaneous edema (Calabar swellings) adult
      worm migration through the sub-conjunctiva (''African eye worm'') and pruritus.
      Generalized itching hives muscle pains arthralgias fatigue and adult worms visibly
      migrating under the surface of the skin may be observed. Severe complications
      such as encephalopathy have been reported in highly infected individuals receiving
      ivermectin during mass drug administration programs for the control of onchocerciasis
      and lymphatic filariasis (see these terms).
