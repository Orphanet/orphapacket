    Contents: Splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma is a rare indolent B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by abnormal proliferation of small monomorphous
      basophilic B-lymphocytes with villous cytoplasm in the splenic red pulp bone
      marrow and peripheral blood. It typically presents in the late clinical stages
      with splenomegaly and moderate lymphocytosis. Cytopenias are rare and likely
      associated with hypersplenism.
