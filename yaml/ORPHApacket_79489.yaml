  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare common cystic lymphatic malformation characterized by a benign
      cystic lesion composed of dilated lymphatic channels. Macrocystic lesions consist
      of cysts larger than 1 cm in diameter. They usually present at birth or during
      the first years of life and most often occur in the head and neck region but
      may affect any site. Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the lesion.
      Infection trauma or intracystic hemorrhage can lead to lesional expansion. Malignant
      transformation does not occur.
