  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by pontocerebellar hypoplasia hypotonia and respiratory insufficiency. Cardiac
      anomalies (particularly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) eye manifestations (congenital
      cataracts corneal clouding) seizures and facial dysmorphism (including microcephaly
      bitemporal narrowing absence of eyelashes short palpebral fissures small and
      low-set ears anteverted nares microstomia and micrognathia) are present in the
      majority of the patients. Additional findings such as hepatosplenomegaly edema
      micropenis/cryptorchidism hypoglycemia hypernatremia increased triglycerides
      elevated plasma lactate and decreased plasma cholesterol were reported. Brain
      imaging may reveal simplified/delayed cortical gyration dilated ventricles and
      periventricular or diffuse white matter abnormalities. It is mostly caused by
      biallelic deletions in the <i>ATAD3</i> gene cluster (<i>ATAD3A</i> <i>ATAD3B</i>
      and <i>ATAD3C</i>) or by point mutations in the <i>ATAD3A</i> gene. Even though
      the syndrome is mostly neonatally lethal some patients regardless of the type
      of the mutation/deletion they harbor may have a less severe condition and may
      survive.
