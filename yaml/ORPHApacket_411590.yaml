  TextSection:
    Contents: Wolfram-like syndrome is a rare endocrine disease characterized by the
      triad of adult-onset diabetes mellitus progressive hearing loss (usually presenting
      in the first decade of life and principally of low to moderate frequencies)
      and/or juvenile-onset optic atrophy. Psychiatric (i.e. anxiety depression hallucinations)
      and sleep disorders the only neurologic abnormalities observed in this disease
      have been reported in rare cases. Unlike Wolfram syndrome patients with Wolfram-like
      syndrome do not report endocrine or cardiac findings.
