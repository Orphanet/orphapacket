      ranging from isolated myopathy or transient hepatopathy to severe multisystem
      disorder (that may include hypotonia failure to thrive psychomotor delay cardiomyopathy
      encephalopathy renal tubulopathy hearing impairment lactic acidosis hypoglycemia
      and other signs and symptoms).
