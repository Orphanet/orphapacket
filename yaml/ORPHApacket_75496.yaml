  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of spondylodysplastic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to variants
      in <i>B4GALT7</i> and characterized by short stature variable degrees of muscle
      hypotonia joint hypermobility especially of the hands and bowing of limbs. Additional
      features include the typical craniofacial gestalt (mid-face hypoplasia round
      flat face proptosis and narrow mouth) hyperextensible skin that is soft thin
      translucent and doughy delayed motor and/or cognitive development characteristic
      radiographic findings (such as radio-ulnar synostosis radial head subluxation
      or dislocation metaphyseal flaring and osteopenia) and ocular abnormalities.
