  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by widespread cutaneous telangiectases
      usually &#64257;rst appearing on the lower limbs and slowly progressing upwards
      to involve the trunk and arms. The lesions can be diffuse localized macular
      plaque-like discrete or con&#64258;uent. Recurrent bleeding from the skin and
      mucous membranes is not a common feature. Likewise co-existing epidermal or
      dermal abnormalities like atrophy depigmentation or purpura are absent. The
      condition is non-hereditary and to establish the diagnosis other primary and
      secondary telangiectases must be excluded.
