  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease with skin involvement characterized by the onset
      of idiopathic lupus erythematosus-like signs and symptoms resulting from continuous
      drug intake (>1 month) which resolve when treatment is discontinued in persons
      with no history of autoimmune disease. Manifestations are variable and may be
      systemic (e.g. arthralgia myalgia fever fatigue serositis pleuritis pericarditis)
      subacute cutaneous (incl. photosensitive non-scarring annular polycyclic or
      papulosquamous lesions malar erythema vasculitis bullous lesions erythema multiforme-like
      changes) and/or chronic cutaneous (typically discoid lesions in sun-exposed
      areas). Procainamide and hydralazine are the drugs most frequently implicated.
