  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic superficial corneal dystrophy disease characterized by
      white elevated epithelial plaques located on the bulbar conjunctiva (sometimes
      with encroachment of the cornea) and oral mucosa (in any part of the oral cavity)
      associated with dilated hyperemic conjunctival blood vessels observed mainly
      in Haliwa-Saponi Native American descendents. Patients may be asymptomatic or
      present with ocular itching superficial corneal scarring excessive lacrimation
      photophobia and visual loss due to corneal opacity. Histologically both ocular
      and oral lesions display acanthosis with hyperkeratosis and prominent dyskeratosis.
