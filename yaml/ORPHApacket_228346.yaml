  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by juvenile or protracted
      juvenile-onset progressive vision loss due to retinal degeneration/retinopathy
      (which in several patients may precede the onset of neurological symptoms by
      some years) seizures progressive cognitive impairment with a precipitous decline
      to dementia progressive motor decline with cerebellar pyramidal and extrapyramidal
      features. Associated systemic features may include cardiac abnormalities (including
      conduction abnormalities ventricular hypertrophy atrial flutter/fibrillation
      and symptomatic bradycardia) and autophagic vacuolar myopathy. Seizures in juvenile-onset
      (also known as the classic form of the disease) patients develop typically within
      2-4 years of the onset of visual deterioration. In protracted form characterized
      by combined focal and generalized epilepsy syndrome and progressive neurologic
      deterioration seizures and other neurological manifestations appear significantly
      later compared to classic form and symptoms are milder. This is the most common
      form of ceroid lipofuscinosis and is widespread across Western countries.
