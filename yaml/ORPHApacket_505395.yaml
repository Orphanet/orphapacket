  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare respiratory disorder characterized by major reduction of diaphragmatic
      contractile force together with fiber atrophy in the diaphragm and other respiratory
      muscles as a consequence of invasive mechanical ventilation. Reduction of diaphragmatic
      contractile force may be observed even within hours after intubation. The condition
      can increase weaning time and affects weaning outcome mortality and long-term
      clinical outcomes.
