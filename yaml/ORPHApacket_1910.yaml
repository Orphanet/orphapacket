  TextSection:
    Contents: Fetal iodine syndrome refers to symptoms and signs that may be observed
      in a fetus or newborn when the mother was exposed during pregnancy to inappropriate
      (insufficient or excessive) amounts of iodine. Iodine deficiency is associated
      with goiter and hypothyroidism. When severe iodine deficiency occurs during
      pregnancy it is associated with congenital hypothyroidism that is manifested
      by increased neonatal morbi-mortality and severe mental dysfunction hyperactivity
      attention disorders and a substantial decrease of IQ of an irreversible nature.
      Excessive iodine ingestion during the third trimester of pregnancy can result
      in hypothyroidism and fetal goiter due to a prolonged inhibition of thyroid
      hormone synthesis an increase in thyrotropin (TSH).
