  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare serpinopathy characterized by progressive myoclonus epilepsy
      and/or pre-senile dementia with prominent frontal-lobe features and relative
      sparing of recall memory. In addition other neurological manifestations like
      cerebellar symptoms and pyramidal signs may be present. Age of onset is variable
      the disease having been reported in children as well as elderly patients. Neuropathological
      examination reveals the typical neuronal inclusions of mutated neuroserpin (Collins
      bodies).
