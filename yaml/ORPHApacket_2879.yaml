  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndrome with limb reduction defects characterized by
      skeletal malformations comprising absent or hypoplastic pelvic bones (including
      sacral agenesis or hypoplasia) intercalary limb deficiencies (phocomelia potentially
      combined with polydactyly oligodactyly or ectrodactyly) and skull defects (frequently
      a defect of the occipital bone with or without meningocele). Additional features
      may include thoracic dystrophy dysmorphic facial features (dysplastic and large
      ears and a high and narrow palate) and genital malformations (Mullerian aplasia
      agenesis of the uterus and vagina micropenis with cryptorchidism). Growth and
      mental development are not affected.
