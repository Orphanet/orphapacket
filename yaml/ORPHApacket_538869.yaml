  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of pyoderma gangrenosum disease characterized by grouped
      vesicles that rapidly spread and coalesce to form large bullae which evolve
      into ulcerations that have an erythematous peripheral halo and central necrosis
      mainly affecting the upper limbs and face. Lymphoproliferative diseases are
      frequently associated thus prognosis is often compromised.
