  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 24 is a rare mitochondrial
      oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized by variable phenotype including
      developmental delay with psychomotor regression intellectual disability epilepsy
      Leigh syndrome non-syndromic hearing loss visual impairment and severe myopathy.
      Decreased activity of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and lactic acidosis
      are common findings and diffuse cerebral atrophy may be associated.
