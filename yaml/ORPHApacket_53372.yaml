  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic tremor disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of
      involuntary tremor of the chin and lower lip due to isolated myoclonus of the
      mentalis muscle. Patients may present more severe symptoms such as tongue biting
      and psychological distress. Even though neurological abnormalities are not associated
      occasional involvement of sleep disorders and other facial muscles have been
      described. Sporadic cases were also reported.
