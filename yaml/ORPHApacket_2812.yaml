  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic skin disorder characterized by very early-onset of progressive
      skin thickening over the entire body (except for eyelids neck and ears) progressively
      limited joint mobility with gradual freezing of joints and eventual severe chest
      and abdomen movement restriction manifesting with restrictive pulmonary disease
      which may lead to death. Additional features include severe growth restriction
      and osteoporosis. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1974.
