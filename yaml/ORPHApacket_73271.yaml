  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic coagulation disorder characterized by a mild to moderate
      bleeding tendency due to impaired platelet activation and aggregation in response
      to collagen or impaired platelet-vessel wall interaction resulting from a collagen
      receptor defect. Patients manifest with ecchymoses epistaxis menorrhagia and/or
      post-traumatic and post-surgery bleeding complications. Laboratory analysis
      reveals prolonged bleeding time and occasionally mild thrombocytopenia.
