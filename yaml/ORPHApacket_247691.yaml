  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cerebral small vessel disease characterized by progressive
      loss of visual acuity due to retinal vasculopathy in combination with more variable
      neurological signs and symptoms including stroke cognitive decline migraine-like
      headaches and seizures among others typically beginning in middle age. Psychiatric
      features such as depression and anxiety may also occur. Systemic vascular involvement
      with Raynaud phenomenon micronodular liver cirrhosis and glomerular kidney dysfunction
      is present in a subset of patients.
