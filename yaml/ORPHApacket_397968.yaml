  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2R is a rare subtype of axonal hereditary
      motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by early-onset axial hypotonia generalized
      muscle weakness absent deep tendon reflexes and decreased muscle mass. Electromyography
      reveals decreased motor nerve conduction velocities with markedly reduced sensory
      and motor amplitudes.
