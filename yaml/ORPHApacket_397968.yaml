    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by early-onset axial hypotonia generalized muscle weakness absent
      deep tendon reflexes and decreased muscle mass. Electromyography reveals decreased
      motor nerve conduction velocities with markedly reduced sensory and motor amplitudes.
