  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a malignant fibroblastic
      lesion with variably myxoid stroma pleomorphism and a distinctively curvilinear
      vascular pattern. The majority of tumors arise in the limbs including the limb
      girdles more often in dermal/subcutaneous tissues than in the underlying fascia
      and skeletal muscle and usually present as a slowly growing painless mass. Depth
      of the lesion and tumor grade do not influence the high rate of local recurrence
      while the percentage of metastasis and tumor-associated mortality are much higher
      in deep-seated and high-grade neoplasms.
