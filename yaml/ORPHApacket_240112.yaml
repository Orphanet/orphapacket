  TextSection:
    Contents: An atypical variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) a rare late-onset
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by an initial presentation of an isolated
      speech and language disorder (apraxia of speech agrammatism and phonemic errors)
      years before developing other motor features of PSP. Neuropathological characteristics
      includes tau pathology and neuronal loss in specific brain areas especially
      in the temporal cortex and superior frontal gyrus.
