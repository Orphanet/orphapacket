  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare maxillo-facial surgical disease characterized by an inflammatory
      granulomatous lesion most commonly of iatrogenic origin due to interaction of
      extravasated erythrocytes with exogenous lipids in particular petrolatum-based
      antibiotic ointment used after surgical procedures. Most frequent locations
      are the paranasal sinuses and jaws although the lesion can occur in any part
      of the body. It is typically found incidentally as an asymptomatic soft tissue
      swelling.
