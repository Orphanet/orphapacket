  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of
      acute leukemia with at least 20% peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts with
      morphological features of myelodysplasia or occurrence in patients with a prior
      history of a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative
      neoplasm with MDS-related cytogenetic abnormalities in the absence of specific
      genetic abnormalities characteristic of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities.
      Prior cytotoxic or radiation therapy for an unrelated disease must be excluded.
      The condition occurs mainly in elderly patients and is rare in children. Patients
      often present with severe pancytopenia. Prognosis is generally poor.
