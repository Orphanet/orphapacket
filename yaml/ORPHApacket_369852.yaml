  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by severe
      congenital neutropenia bone marrow fibrosis and neutrophil dysfunction which
      is refractory to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor manifesting with life-threatening
      infections and/or deep-seated abscesses hepato-/splenomegaly thrombocytopenia
      hypergammaglobulinemia anemia with reticulocytosis and nephromegaly. Other reported
      features include osteosclerosis and neurological abnormalities (e.g. developmental
      delay cortical blindness hearing loss thin corpus callosum or dysrhythmia on
      EEG).
