  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by palpable slow-growing deep-seated
      swellings with or without pain or tenderness affecting mostly children and young
      adults. Patients may have pain or joint contractures that precede swelling.
      Contrary to its name lesions do not originate from intra-articular synovium
      but from primitive mesenchymal cells. Majority of the lesions arise in the extremities
      predominantly in the lower extremity however can also occur in the head and
      neck region trunk lungs and pleura. Metastasis to the lungs bone and regional
      lymph nodes can be observed. Increasing size age and tumor grade are reported
      as negative predictive factors for both local disease recurrence and metastasis.
