  TextSection:
    Contents: Synovial sarcoma is an aggressive soft tissue sarcoma (see this term)
      occurring most commonly in adolescents and young adults (15 to 40 years) usually
      localized near the large joints of the extremities but also in the head and
      neck mediastinum and viscera (lung kidney etc) clinically presenting as a deep
      seated swelling or a painful mass often with an initial indolent course and
      is characterized by its local invasiveness and a propensity to metastasize.
      The origin of synovial sarcoma is likely from multipotent mesenchymal cells
      and not synovium (contrary to its name).
