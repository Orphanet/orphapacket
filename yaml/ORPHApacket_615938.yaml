    Contents: A rare disorder of fatty acid biosynthesis characterized by spastic
      paraparesis bilateral congenital/juvenile cataracts gross motor developmental
      delay speech delay and truncal hypotonia. Seizures in infancy can also be observed.
      Patients have elevated levels of ether lipids including plasmalogen. Majority
      of the affected individuals have normal brain imaging and normal growth. No
