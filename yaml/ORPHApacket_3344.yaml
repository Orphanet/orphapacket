  TextSection:
    Contents: Weismann-Netter syndrome is a rare genetic primary bent bone dysplasia
      characterized by anterior diaphyseal bowing of the tibia and fibula broadening
      of the fibula posterior cortical thickening of both bones and short stature.
      Additional skeletal abnormalities include scoliosis with marked lumbar lordosis
      horizontal sacrum and square iliac wings and/or less frequently vertebral malformations
      abnormal shape of the clavicles and ribs calvarial hyperostosis and delayed
      eruption of permanent teeth. Delayed ambulation is also frequently associated.
