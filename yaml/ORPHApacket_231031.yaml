    Contents: Erythema palmare hereditarium is a rare benign congenital genetic skin
      disorder characterized by permanent and asymptomatic erythema of the palmar
      and less frequently the solar surfaces. In most cases it presents with sharply
      demarcated redness of the thenar and hypothenar eminences as well as the palmar
      aspect of the phalanges with scattered telangiectasia spots that do not cause
      any discomfort (pain itching or burning) to the patient.
