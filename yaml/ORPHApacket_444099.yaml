  TextSection:
    Contents: A pure form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by adult
      onset of crural spastic paraparesis hyperreflexia extensor plantar responses
      proximal muscle weakness mild muscle atrophy decreased vibration sensation at
      ankles and mild urinary dysfunction. Foot deformities have been reported to
      eventually occur in some patients. No abnormalities are noted on brain magnetic
      resonance imaging and peripheral nerve conduction velocity studies.
