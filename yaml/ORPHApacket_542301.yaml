    Contents: A rare immune dysregulation disease with immunodeficiency characterized
      by infantile or childhood onset of a variable phenotype including recurrent/persistent
      bacterial fungal and viral infections with involvement of the skin lower respiratory
      tract and gastrointestinal tract eczema allergies and inflammatory bowel disease
      among others. EBV-related smooth muscle tumors have also been reported. Immunophenotyping
      shows decreased Treg counts as well as a deficient CD3/CD28 co-stimulation response
      in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells.
