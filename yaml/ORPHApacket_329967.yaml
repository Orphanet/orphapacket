  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare rheumatologic disease characterized by recurrent self-remitting
      episodes of acute monoarticular arthritis often with a fixed periodicity typically
      affecting the knee or another large joint which develops an effusion over 12
      to 24 hours with only mild to moderate pain and minimal signs of inflammation.
      Attacks last three to five days and may parallel menses in females. Systemic
      symptoms are absent and no joint damage occurs.
