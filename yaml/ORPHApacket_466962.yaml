  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a compressive mass located
      in the mediastinum and/or pleura and lung including prominent lymph node involvement
      histologically poorly differentiated and frequently showing rhabdoid features.
      Loss of SMARCA4 is typically accompanied by SMARCA2-deficiency. Presenting symptoms
      include dyspnea cough chest pain or dysphagia among others. The tumors are aggressive
      with limited response to chemotherapies rapid local progression high recurrence
      rate after surgical resection and short median survival times. There is a strong
      association with smoking.
