  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of renal hypoplasia characterized by bilateral small kidneys
      with a deficit in the number of nephrons present. The condition is typically
      asymptomatic but may be associated with hypertension and some excretory functional
      limitations as well as eventual chronic renal failure.
