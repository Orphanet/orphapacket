  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by congenital
      or early-onset lactic acidosis hypotonia and severe global developmental delay
      with feeding difficulties and failure to thrive. It is frequently associated
      with variable dysmorphic facial features. Additional manifestations include
      seizures movement disorders and cardiac and ophthalmologic anomalies among others.
      Brain imaging may show generalized atrophy and white matter abnormalities.
