  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (C-ALCL) is a rare
      T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin and generally shows no extracutaneous
      involvement at presentation. It belongs to the spectrum of primary cutaneous
      CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders along with lymphomatoid papulosis (see this
      term) with which it shares overlapping clinical and histopathologic features.
