  TextSection:
    Contents: Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) deficiency is a metabolic disorder characterised
      by prolonged apnoea after the use of certain anaesthetic drugs including the
      muscle relaxants succinylcholine or mivacurium and other ester local anaesthetics.
      The duration of the prolonged apnoea varies significantly depending on the extent
      of the enzyme deficiency.
