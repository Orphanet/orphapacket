  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by developmental
      and motor regression seizures ataxia intellectual disability delayed global
      development speech and language spasticity and hypotonia. Visual impairment
      is not always present. It may present with late infantile (5-7 years) juvenile
      (4-8 years) or adult-onset (30 years). Progressive myoclonus epilepsy with myoclonic
      and tonic-clonic seizures limb weakness dysarthria are mainly associated with
      the adult-onset form of the disease and these patients commonly have photosensitivity
      (sometimes extreme) whereas vision loss is infrequent.
