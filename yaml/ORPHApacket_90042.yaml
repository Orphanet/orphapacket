  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary familial polycythemia is an inherited hematological disorder
      resulting from mutations in the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor and is characterized
      by an elevated absolute red blood cell mass caused by uncontrolled red blood
      cell production in the presence of low EPO levels.
