  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal trisomy 3p is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from
      the partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 3 with highly variable
      phenotype principally characterized by craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. brachy-/microcephaly
      square facies frontal bossing bitemporal indentation hypertelorism/telecanthus
      low-set and/or dysmorphic ears short nose with broad flat nasal bridge prominent
      cheeks and philtrum downturned corners of mouth micrognathia/retrognathia short
      neck) associated with psychomotor delay moderate to severe intellectual disability
      cardiac (e.g. patent ductus arteriosus) and urogenital (e.g. renal hypoplasia
      hypogenitalism) abnormalities as well as seizures and presence of whorls on
      fingers.
