  TextSection:
    Contents: Postpoliomyelitis syndrome (PPS) is a neurologic disorder characterized
      by the development of new neuromuscular symptoms such as progressive muscular
      weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability occurring in survivors of the acute
      paralytic form of poliomyelitis (see this term) 15-40 years after recovery from
      the disease and that is unexplained by other medical causes. Other manifestations
      that can occur gradually include generalized fatigue muscle atrophy muscle and
      joint pain intolerance to cold and difficulties sleeping swallowing or breathing.
