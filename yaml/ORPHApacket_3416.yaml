  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperostosis corticalis generalisata also known as van Buchem disease
      is a rare craniotubular hyperostosis characterized by hyperostosis of the skull
      mandible clavicles ribs and diaphyses of the long bones as well as the tubular
      bones of the hands and feet. Clinical manifestations include increased skull
      thickness with cranial nerve entrapment causing inconsistent cranial nerve palsies.
