    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a malignant epithelial neoplasm
      with evidence of squamous differentiation most commonly located in the piriform
      sinus less frequently the posterior pharyngeal wall or the postcricoid area.
      The tumor can spread directly to adjacent structures or metastasize via lymphatic
      and blood vessels to regional lymph nodes or lung liver and bones respectively.
      Primary risk factors are tobacco smoking and (to a lesser extent) alcohol consumption.
