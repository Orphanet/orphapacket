  TextSection:
    Contents: CHST3-related skeletal dysplasia is a very rare bone disorder characterized
      clinically by short stature of prenatal onset; dislocation of the knees hips
      or elbows; club feet; limitation of range of motion of large joints; progressive
      kyphosis; and occasional scoliosis. In a few patients minor heart valve dysplasia
      has also been described. Intellect vision and hearing are normal.
