  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic amyloidosis characterized by slowly progressive renal
      disease presenting with proteinuria hypertension and decreased glomerular filtration
      rate leading to progressive renal failure. Histology reveals amyloid deposits
      of leukocyte chemotactic factor-2 protein in the renal cortical interstitium
      tubular basement membranes glomeruli and the vessel walls. Extra-renal deposits
      can be seen in the liver lungs spleen and adrenal glands.
