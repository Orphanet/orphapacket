    Contents: A rare biliary tract disease characterized by loss of interlobular bile
      ducts resulting in chronic cholestasis without any known cause. Loss of less
      than 50% of interlobular bile ducts is associated with a mild disease course
      while loss of the majority of ducts results in a severe form potentially leading
      to cirrhosis and liver failure. Patients typically present as young or middle-aged
      adults with episodic jaundice pruritus and elevated liver enzymes.
