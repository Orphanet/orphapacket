  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Isolated complex I deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism
      due to mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial genes encoding subunits or assembly
      factors of the human mitochondrial complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase)
      and is characterized by a wide range of manifestations including marked and
      often fatal lactic acidosis cardiomyopathy leukoencephalopathy pure myopathy
      and hepatopathy with tubulopathy. Among the numerous clinical phenotypes observed
      are Leigh syndrome Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and MELAS syndrome (see
      these terms).'
