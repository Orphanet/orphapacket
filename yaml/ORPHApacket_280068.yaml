    Contents: A rare life-threatening non-inflammatory vasculopathy characterized
      by diffuse precipitation of calcium in viscera (mainly in the heart or lungs
      but also in the stomach or kidneys) leading to fibrosis and thrombosis which
      eventually causes tissue necrosis. Depending on the affected organ patients
      may present with dyspnea cough and respiratory failure or acute heart block
      and subsequent sudden cardiac death. The disease predominantly affects patients
      with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) on dialysis.
