  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary bone displasia characterized by disproportionate
      short stature with short stiff neck and trunk and relatively long limbs fingers
      and toes (which may present flexion contractures) severe vertebral body ossification
      delay (with frequent pycnodysostosis) markedly enlarged round epiphyses of the
      long bones absent ossification of pubic bones and multiple pseudoepiphyses of
      the short tubular bones in hands and feet. Neurological manifestations resulting
      from cervical spine instability may be observed.
