  TextSection:
    Contents: Vitamin K antagonist embryofetopathy is characterized by a group of
      symptoms that may be observed in a fetus or newborn when the mother has taken
      oral vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin during pregnancy. Vitamin K antagonists
      are anticoagulant drugs that provide efficient thromboprophylaxis and that can
      cross the placenta. 5-12 % of infants exposed to warfarin between 6-9 weeks
      gestation present nasal hypoplasia and skeletal abnormalities including short
      limbs and digits (brachydactyly) and stippled epiphyses. Warfarin fetopathy
      with central nervous system abnormalities (hydrocephalus intellectual disability
      spasticity and hypotonia) or ocular abnormalities (microphthalmia cataract optic
      atrophy) fetal loss and stillbirth occurs in infants exposed at later gestations.
      Additional features that have been reported after in utero warfarin exposure
      include facial dysmorphism (cleft lip and/or palate malformed ears) choanal
      atresia or stenosis aorta coarctation situs inversus totalis bilobed lungs and
      ventral midline dysplasia.
