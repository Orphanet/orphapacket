  TextSection:
    Contents: RIN2 syndrome formerly known as macrocephaly alopecia cutis laxa and
      scoliosis (MACS) syndrome is a very rare inherited connective tissue disorder
      characterized by macrocephaly sparse scalp hair soft-redundant and hyperextensible
      skin joint hypermobility and scoliosis. Patients have progressive facial coarsening
      with downslanted palpebral fissures upper eyelid fullness/infraorbital folds
      thick/everted vermillion gingival overgrowth and abnormal position of the teeth.
      Rarer manifestations such as abnormal high-pitched voice bronchiectasis hypergonadotropic
      hypergonadism and brachydactyly (see this term) have also been reported.
