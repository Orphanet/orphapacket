  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by hydranencephaly
      distinctive glomeruloid vasculopathy in the central nervous system and retina
      polyhydramnios and fetal akinesia with arthrogryposis. The disorder is usually
      prenatally lethal. In rare reported cases that survived beyond infancy severe
      intellectual and neurologic disability with seizures microcephaly and absence
      of functional movements were reported.
