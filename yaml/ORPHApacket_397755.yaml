    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular channelopathy characterized by normokalemic
      episodes of painful muscle cramping followed by progressive permanent flaccid
      weakness triggered by stress cold and exercise associated with myopathic myopathy
      and painful acute edema with neuronal compression foot drop and muscle degeneration
      when located in the tibialis anterior muscle group.
