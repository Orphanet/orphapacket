  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-syndromic limb malformation characterized by delayed
      union or non-union of a long bone resulting in formation of a false joint with
      abnormal mobility and angulation at the pseudoarthrosis site which manifests
      with progressive anterolateral forearm or leg bowing limb shortening and non-healing
      fractures. Typical histopathological findings include fibromatosis-like proliferation
      in the soft tissues with cystic or dysplastic lesions. Neurofibromatosis and
      osteofibrous dysplasia are frequently associated.
