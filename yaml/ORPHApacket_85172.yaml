  TextSection:
    Contents: Microcephalic osteodysplastic dysplasia Saul-Wilson type is a skeletal
      dysplasia characterized by a distinct facial phenotype short stature brachydactyly
      clubfoot deformities cataracts and microcephaly. It has been described in four
      patients. Facial features include frontal bossing with a depression over the
      metopic suture a narrow nasal root with a beaked nose and midfacial hypoplasia
      with prominent eyes. Characteristic radiographic findings are observed (irregularities
      of the vertebral bodies hypoplasia of the odontoid process short phalanges coning
      several epiphyses <i>etc.</i>).
