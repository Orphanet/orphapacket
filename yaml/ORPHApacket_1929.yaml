  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inflammatory and autoimmune disease with epilepsy characterized
      by unilateral hemispheric atrophy associated with drug-resistant focal epilepsy
      progressive hemiplegia and cognitive decline. The disease mainly affects children
      and begins with a prodromal period with mild hemiparesis or infrequent seizures
      lasting up to several years. The acute stage is marked by frequent seizures
      arising from one cerebral hemisphere followed by a residual stage with persistent
      severe neurological deficits and relapsing epilepsy.
