  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by global
      developmental delay and severe intellectual disability seizures and recurrent
      lower respiratory tract infections resulting in premature death in affected
      males. Additional reported manifestations include mild dysmorphic facial features
      (such as epicanthic folds high nasal bridge or small mouth) gait disturbances
      brisk tendon reflexes delayed bone age and tapering fingers. No evident heterozygous
      manifestation has been reported in females.
