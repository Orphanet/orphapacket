    Contents: A rare genetic primary lymphedema characterized by lymphedema of all
      four limbs with age of onset ranging from birth to adulthood. Manifestations
      are of variable severity and upper limb involvement may develop only later in
      the disease course. Recurrent episodes of cellulitis and skin infections are
      observed in severe cases. Varicose veins and venous incompetence have been reported
      in association.
