    Contents: Ring chromosome 6 syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with
      highly variable phenotype principally characterized by prenatal/postnatal growth
      failure intellectual disability developmental delay craniofacial dysmorphism
      (incl. microcephaly microphthalmia epicanthus low-set and malformed ears broad
      and flat nasal bridge full lips micrognathia) central nervous system anomalies
      (e.g. hydrocephalus cortical atrophy ventriculomegaly) short neck and delayed
      bone age. Cardiac defects limb anomalies hip joint malformations and seizures
      have also been reported.
