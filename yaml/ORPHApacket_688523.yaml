  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare venous malformation characterized by splenic non-encapsulated
      non-neoplastic vascular channels of varying sizes (ranging from capillaries
      to cavernous vessels) containing slow-flowing blood. The majority of patients
      are asymptomatic and the condition is usually discovered incidentally. When
      patients are symptomatic they may present with dyspnea abdominal pain splenomegaly
      diarrhea or constipation. Lesions are usually benign with no malignant potential.
      However very large lesions may require splenectomy due to their increased risk
      of rupture which may lead to intra-abdominal hemorrhage.
