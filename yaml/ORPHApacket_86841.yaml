  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by macrocytic anemia (with
      or without other cytopenias and/or thrombocytosis) and with del(5q) occurring
      either in isolation or with one other cytogenetic abnormality other than monosomy
      7 or del(7q). The bone marrow is typically hypercellular with erythroid hypoplasia
      and increased numbers of megakaryocytes which show non-lobated and hypolobated
      nuclei. Myeloblasts constitute less than 5% of the nucleated bone marrow cells
      and less than 1% of the peripheral blood leukocytes. Auer rods are absent. Ring
      sideroblasts may be observed. Patients present with anemia and often thrombocytosis
      while thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia are uncommon. Transformation to acute
      myeloid leukemia may occur in a small number of patients.
