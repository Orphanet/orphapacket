  TextSection:
    Contents: A primary bone dysplasia characterized by premature degenerative arthropathy
      of the hip. The disease presents with hip joint discomfort/pain and gait disturbances
      that usually develop in childhood and that progress to severe functional disability
      and limited mobility by early adulthood. Involvement of the vertebral bodies
      and other joints is minimal height is not significantly reduced and general
      health is unimpaired. Radiographically the femoral heads are flattened and irregular
      and degenerative osteoarthritis develops in the hip joints as evidenced by the
      presence of periarticular cysts sclerosis and joint space narrowing.
