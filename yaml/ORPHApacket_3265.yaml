  TextSection:
    Contents: Humero-radial synostosis is a rare genetic congenital joint formation
      defect disorder characterized by uni- or bilateral fusion of the humerus and
      radius bones at the elbow level with or without associated ulnar and carpal/metacarpal
      deficiency leading to loss of elbow motion and in many cases functional arm
      incapacity. Bowing of radius may be additionally present.
