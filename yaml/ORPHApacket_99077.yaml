  TextSection:
    Contents: Kommerell diverticulum (KD) is a developmental anomaly of the aortic
      arch characterized by a diverticulum at the proximal descending aorta of left
      or right arch configuration that gives rise to an aberrant subclavian artery.
      KD is primarily asymptomatic but may become symptomatic secondary to dilatation
      of KD atheroma and fibrotic changes in paratracheal or paraesophageal tissue
      presenting with signs of tracheal compression (more common in children) esophageal
      compression (dysphagia lusoria; more common in patients with a right sided aortic
      arch) chest pain or blood pressure difference in the upper limbs. KD may also
      predispose toward aortic dissection or rupture.
