  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital anomaly of the great veins characterized by unilateral
      or bilateral complete absence of the superior vena cava (SVC). Unilateral agenesis
      is mainly asymptomatic (most of the time diagnosed incidentally) and patients
      usually have otherwise normal heart structure. Bilateral agenesis however is
      frequently associated with other congenital cardiac anomalies and/or conduction
      abnormalities (such as tetralogy of Fallot atrial septal defect) and typically
      present symptoms of SVC syndrome.
