  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia syndrome characterized by growth retardation
      with proportionate short stature cortical thickening and medullary stenosis
      of the long bones delayed anterior fontanelle closure hypocalcemia due to congenital
      hypoparathyroidism and facial dysmorphism including prominent forehead microphthalmia
      and micrognathia. Additional manifestations include ocular and dental anomalies
      (e.g. corneal opacity hyperopia optic atrophy tortuous retinal vessels dental
      caries enamel defects) and occasionally hypoplastic nails and neonatal liver
      disease. Inheritance may be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive with more
      severe growth retardation small hands and feet intellectual disability microcephaly
      and recurrent bacterial infections being observed in the latter.
