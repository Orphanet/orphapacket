  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated ankyloblepharon filiforme adnatum (AFA) is characterised by
      the presence of single or multiple thin bands of connective tissue between the
      upper and lower eyelids preventing full opening of the eye. Several cases have
      been reported. It can occur sporadically or following an autosomal dominant
      transmission pattern. In some cases AFA can be associated with other disorders
      such as trisomy 18. The bands should be removed to avoid amblyopia and this
      can easily be performed in the neonatal period by cutting with tissue scissors.
