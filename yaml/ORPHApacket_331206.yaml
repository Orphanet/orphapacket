  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe combined immunodeficiency due to complete RAG1/2 deficiency is
      a rare genetic T-B- severe combined immunodeficiency disorder due to null mutations
      in recombination activating gene (RAG) 1 and/or RAG2 resulting in less than
      1% of wild type V(D)J recombination activity. Patients present with neonatal
      onset of life-threatening severe recurrent infections by opportunistic fungal
      viral and bacterial micro-organisms as well as skin rashes chronic diarrhea
      failure to thrive and fever. Immunologic observations include profound T- and
      B-cell lymphopenia normal NK counts and low or absent serum immunoglobulins;
      some patients may have eosinophilia.
