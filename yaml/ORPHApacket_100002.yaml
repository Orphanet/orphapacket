  TextSection:
    Contents: Extraneural perineurioma is a rare tumor of cranial and spinal nerves
      arising from peripheral nerve sheet and composed exclusively or predominantly
      of cells showing perineurial differentiation. It presents as a well-circumscribed
      rarely encapsulated mass not associated with a recognizable nerve most commonly
      arising in the dermis and subcutis of the extremities or trunk or rarely in
      deep soft tissue or skin (e.g. in the stomach kidney pancreas maxillary sinus
      mandible bronchial tree and the face). The clinical presentation depends on
      the localization.
