  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bone development disorder characterized by localized asymmetric
      osteochondral overgrowth affecting single or multiple epiphyses most commonly
      the distal femur proximal tibia and talus. The lesions are typically restricted
      to one side of the epiphysis with the medial side being affected twice as often
      as the lateral side. The condition is usually diagnosed in children and three
      times more often in boys than in girls. Patients present with pain limitation
      in range of motion and deformity or swelling of the affected joint.
