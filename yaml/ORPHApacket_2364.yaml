  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic glycogen storage disease characterized by either lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) M- or H-subunit deficiency. Main features of LDH M-subunit
      deficiency are exertional fatigue and muscle pain potentially accompanied by
      myoglobinuria. Some patients may develop pustular psoriasis-like skin lesions.
      Complications of pregnancy such as frequent abdominal pains and increased uterine
      tone with a risk of dystocia have also been described. LDH H-subunit deficiency
      manifests with low serum LDH activity of unclear clinical relevance.
