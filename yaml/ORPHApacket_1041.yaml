  TextSection:
    Contents: Hydrops fetalis is a severe and challenging fetal condition usually
      defined as the excessive accumulation of fetal fluid within the fetal extravascular
      compartments and body cavities that manifests as edema pleural and pericardial
      effusion and ascites. It is the end-stage of a wide variety of disorders. The
      cause may be immunologic (immune hydrops fetalis IHF) or non immunologic (non-immune
      hydrops fetalis NIHF) depending on the presence or absence of maternal antibodies
      against fetal red cell antigens (ABO incompatibility or rhesus (Rh) incompatibility).
