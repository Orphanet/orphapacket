  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic female infertility characterized by oocyte maturation
      arrest during any of the various stages of meiosis I or II. In some patients
      first polar body oocytes may be retrieved but these either show fertilization
      failure or early embryonic arrest. Affected women have regular menstrual cycles.
