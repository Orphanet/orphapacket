  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) refers to a group of diseases
      characterized by a deficit in the degradation of cytoplasmic triglycerides and
      their accumulation in cytoplasmic lipid vacuoles in most tissues of the body.
      The group is heterogeneous: currently cases of NLSD with icthyosis (NLSDI/Dorfman-Chanarin
      disease) and NLSD with myopathy (NLSDM/neutral lipid storage myopathy) can be
      distinguished.'
