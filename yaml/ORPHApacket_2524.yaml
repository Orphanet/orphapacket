  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia characterized by pontocerebellar
      hypoplasia and progressive neocortical atrophy that manifests clinically with
      uncoordinated sucking and swallowing and generalized clonus in the neonate.
      In early childhood spasticity chorea/dyskinesia seizures and progressive microcephaly
      develop. Voluntary motor development is lacking.
