    Contents: A rare genetic dermis elastic tissue disease characterized by redundant
      overfolded skin of variable severity ranging from wrinkly skin to cutis laxa
      associated with pre- and post-natal growth retardation hypotonia mild to moderate
      developmental delay late closure of anterior fontanelle and craniofacial dysmorphism
      (including microcephaly hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures large
      prominent nasal root with funnel nose small low-set ears long philtrum drooping
      facial skin). Additional manifestations may include seizures intellectual disability
      congenital hip dislocation inguinal hernia and cortical and cerebellar malformations.
      Pretibial pseudo-ecchymotic skin lesions have occasionally been associated.
