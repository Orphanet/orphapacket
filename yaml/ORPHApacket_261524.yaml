  TextSection:
    Contents: A uniparental disomy of paternal origin that does not seem to have an
      adverse impact on the phenotype of an individual. There is a possibility of
      homozygosity for a recessive disease mutation for which the father is a carrier
      and specific phenotype depends on the inherited disorder.
