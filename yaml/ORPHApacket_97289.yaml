  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant primary thymic neoplasm originating from neuroendocrine
      cells presenting as a mass within the anterior mediastinum. Patients typically
      present with nonspecific symptoms such as chest pain cough shortness of breath
      or in some cases superior vena cava syndrome although patients could be asymptomatic
      during the early stages or present with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I.
      Ectopic production of ACTH and serotonin can lead to Cushing syndrome and carcinoid
      syndrome respectively.
