  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital sensory neuropathy characterized by selective or generalized
      loss of pain perception and impaired temperature sensitivity in the absence
      of other abnormal neurological function. Patients present with variable severity
      of insensibility to pain and temperature. Self-mutilation of the lips tongue
      and fingers painless injuries resulting in cuts bruises fractures destroyed
      joints (Charcot joints) mostly in the knees and and feet are frequentyly observed.
      Patients have normal motor and sensory nerve conduction. Nerve biopsy typically
      manifest with reduced/absent small myelinated fibers whereas unmyelinated fibers
      are usually not affected. Episodic increase in body temperature skin blotching
      decreased sweating poor wound healing infections in teeth joints and bone neurotrophic
      keratitis prematurely aged appearance with malar hypoplasia sunken eyes are
      reported in few patients. Mild intellectual disability may also be present.
