  TextSection:
    Contents: Posterior meningocele is a rare neural tube closure defect characterized
      by the herniation of a cerebrospinal fluid-filled sac that is lined by dura
      and arachnoid mater through a posterior spina bifida and covered by a layer
      of skin of variable thickness which may be dysplastic or ulcerated. The spinal
      cord and nerves are generally not included and function normally although sometimes
      a tethered cord may be associated. They are most commonly located in the lumbar
      or sacral region.
