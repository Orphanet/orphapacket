    Contents: A rare head and neck malformation characterized by congenital partial
      (hypoglossia) or total (aglossia) absence of the tongue. Patients present feeding
      and respiratory difficulties as well as delayed speech development and slurred
      speech. Taste perception is not severely compromised. Associated features include
      a characteristic facies due to mandibular transverse arch deficiency oligodontia
      and malocclusion among others.
