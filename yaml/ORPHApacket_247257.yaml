  TextSection:
    Contents: Inhalational anthrax is a rare acute systemic infection caused by the
      inhalation of <i>Bacillus anthracis</i> spores (e.g. through infected animal
      products bioterrorism) and characterized by an initial stage where patients
      present with non specific symptoms (fever cough chills fatigue) that is followed
      by an acute phase during which hemorrhagic mediastinitis occurs that can progress
      into meningitis gastrointestinal involvement and refractory shock that can be
      fatal if left untreated.
