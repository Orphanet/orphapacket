  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital malformations/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by osteogenesis imperfecta with multiple prenatal bone fractures joint laxity
      severe microcephaly and bilateral cataracts. Additional reported manifestations
      include dysmorphic facial features (such as blue sclerae hypertelorism and low-set
      ears) lissencephaly hydrocephalus and cardiac and genital anomalies. The syndrome
      is lethal <i>in utero</i> or shortly after birth. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1978.
