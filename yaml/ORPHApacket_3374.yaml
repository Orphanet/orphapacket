  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by unilateral
      duplication of an eye which may appear as a synophthalmic eye in a single orbit
      or as two separate unilateral eyes each in a separate orbit. The malformation
      is always associated with other anomalies of the central nervous system (such
      as porencephaly meningocele or arachnoidal cysts) and with craniofacial abnormalities.
      A proboscis is often found. Clinically moderate mental retardation and epilepsy
      are typical.
