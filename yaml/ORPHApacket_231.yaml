  TextSection:
    Contents: Dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease) is a neglected tropical disease
      (NTD) characterized by a painful burning skin lesion from which the <i>Dracunculus
      medinensis</i> parasite emerges approximately 1 year after infection resulting
      from consumption of unsafe drinking water containing parasite-infected copepods
      (<i>Cyclops spp.</i> microcrustacea also called water fleas).
