  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by intermediate
      motor median nerve conduction velocities (usually between 25 and 45 m/s) and
      signs of both axonal degeneration and demyelination without onion bulbs in nerve
      biopsies. It presents with usual Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease clinical features
      of variable severity (progressive muscle weakness and atrophy of the distal
      extremities distal sensory loss reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes and feet
      deformities). Other findings in some of the families include debilitating neuropathic
      pain and mild postural/kinetic upper limb tremor.
