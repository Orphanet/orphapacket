  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by motor-predominant axonal polyneuropathy due to a defect in
      copper metabolism. Patients become symptomatic in infancy or childhood with
      subtle motor delay or regression manifesting with progressive weakness muscle
      wasting and absent reflexes in the lower and upper extremities. In addition
      vibratory sensation is mildly diminished. Involvement of the face with weakness
      and fasciculation of facial muscles has also been described.
