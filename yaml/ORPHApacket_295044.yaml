  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic limb overgrowth characterized by isolated congenital
      enlargement of some or all tissue elements of one or more digits of the hand
      typically within a peripheral nerve territory with the nerve itself being elongated
      as well as increased in diameter. The index finger is most commonly affected.
      If two or more digits are involved these are always adjacent. The enlargement
      may be progressive with disproportionate or static with proportionate growth
      and can be unilateral or bilateral. Patients may experience pain and reduced
      range of motion.
