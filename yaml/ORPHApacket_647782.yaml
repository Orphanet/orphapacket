    Contents: A rare adrenocortical nodular disease characterized by bilateral multiple
      micronodules (<1&nbsp;cm) typically associated with endogenous Cushing syndrome
      that occurs predominantly in children and young adults (females in majority).
      Pigmentation and inter-nodular adrenal cortical atrophy (histological findings
      present in primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease) are generally absent.
