    Contents: A rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia characterized by extensive
      diffuse intra-alveolar accumulation of pigment-laden macrophages most commonly
      associated with long-term exposure to tobacco smoke. Patients present with slowly
      progressive shortness of breath on exertion and chronic cough with bilateral
      crackles. Digital clubbing is also frequently observed. Pulmonary function test
      reveals a restrictive pattern. Computed tomography typically shows diffuse ground-glass
