  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 13 is a rare mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      normal early development followed by the sudden onset in infancy of poor feeding
      dysphagia truncal (followed by global) hypotonia motor regression abnormal movements
      (i.e. severe dystonia of limbs choreoathetosis facial dyskinesias) and reduced
      tendon reflexes. The disease course is severe but nonprogressive.
