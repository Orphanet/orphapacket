    Contents: A rare deafness characterized by the association of bilateral sensorineural
      hearing loss and white hair with scattered black tufts as well as skin areas
      of hyper- and hypopigmentation. Additional reported features include global
      developmental delay and moderate intellectual disability growth retardation
      microcephaly hypotonia mild dysmorphic facial features (deeply set eyes broad
      nasal bridge slight bowing of the upper lip) retinal depigmentation anomalies
      of the fingers and toes and white matter abnormalities on brain imaging.
