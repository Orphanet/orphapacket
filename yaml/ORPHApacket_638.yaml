  TextSection:
    Contents: "Neurofibromatosis-Noonan syndrome (NFNS) is a RASopathy and a variant\
      \ of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) characterized by the combination of features\
      \ of NF1 such as caf\xE9-au-lait spots iris Lisch nodules axillary and inguinal\
      \ freckling optic nerve glioma and multiple neurofibromas and Noonan syndrome\
      \ (NS) such as short stature typical facial features (hypertelorism ptosis downslanting\
      \ palpebral fissures low-set posteriorly rotated ears with a thickened helix\
      \ and a broad forehead) congenital heart defects and unusual pectus deformity.\
      \ As these three entities have significant phenotypic overlap molecular genetic\
      \ testing is often necessary for a correct diagnosis (such as when caf\xE9-au-lait\
      \ spots are present in patients diagnosed with NS)."
