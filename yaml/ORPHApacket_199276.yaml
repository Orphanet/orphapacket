  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic subcutaneous tissue disease characterized by slow growth
      of numerous painless encapsulated lipomas located predominantly in the subcutaneous
      adipose tissue of the trunk and limbs with relative sparing of the head neck
      and shoulders. Clinical presentation mostly becomes evident in the third decade
      where a significant increase in size and number of lipomas is observed. At this
      stage they may cause discomfort and difficulty in performing daily physical
      tasks otherwise they remain painless.
