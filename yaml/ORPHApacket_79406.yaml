  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa characterized by onset in
      childhood or young adulthood of blistering that first occurs around nails accompanied
      by nail dystrophy and shedding and then affects the hands and feet and to a
      lesser extent the elbows and knees. Lesions heal with atrophic scarring. Other
      manifestations include disappearance of dermatoglyphs and palmoplantar hyperhidrosis.
      Extracutaneous involvement is restricted to soft tissue abnormalities of the
      oral cavity and enamel defects with development of caries.
