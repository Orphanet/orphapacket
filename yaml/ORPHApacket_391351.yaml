  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 characterized by childhood
      onset of severe progressive demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy manifesting
      with distal muscle weakness and atrophy of hands and feet distal sensory impairment
      (vibration and pinprick) of lower limbs lactic acidosis areflexia and severely
      reduced motor nerve conduction velocities (25 m/s or less). Patients may also
      present kyphoscoliosis nystagmus hearing loss cerebellar ataxia and/or brain
      MRI abnormalities (putaminal and periaqueductal lesions).
