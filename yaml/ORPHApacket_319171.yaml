    Contents: Distal 17p13.1 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly
      syndrome characterized by mild global developmental delay/intellectual disability
      with poor to absent speech dysmorphic features (long midface retrognathia with
      overbite protruding ears) microcephaly failure to thrive wide-based gait and
      a body posture with knee and elbow flexion and hands held in a midline.
