  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by aplasia cutis
      congenita and epibulbar dermoids. Affected individuals present mostly with multiple
      asymmetrically distributed hairless non scarring atrophic congenital scalp lesions
      and unilateral or bilateral epibulbar dermoids with or without other ocular
      anomalies (including strabismus nystagmus microcornea and microphthalmia). Eyelid
      coloboma acrochordons linear/cutaneous hyperpigmentation mostly following Blaschko
      lines can also be present. Giant cell granulomas of the jaws and nonossifying
      fibromas of the long bones are commonly observed in individuals starting from
      5 years old. Additional and variable clinical features including growth failure
      neurodevelopmental delay epilepsy learning difficulties behavioral abnormalities
      lymphedema macrocephaly cardiovascular defects facial asymmetry and mild dysmorphism
      were reported in some patients.
