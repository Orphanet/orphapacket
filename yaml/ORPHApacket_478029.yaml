  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by microcephaly global developmental delay spastic-dystonic movement disorder
      intractable seizures optic atrophy autonomic dysfunction and peripheral neuropathy.
      Serum lactate is increased and muscle biopsy shows decreased activity of mitochondrial
      respiratory complexes I and III. Brain imaging reveals progressive cerebellar
      atrophy and delayed myelination.
