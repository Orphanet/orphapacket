    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by profound intellectual disability with absent speech severe infantile hypotonia
      with decreased or absent reflexes markedly slow motor development (with no progress
      beyond the ability to sit independently) early-onset epilepsy strabismus and
      post-natal onset of progressive brain atrophy (including loss of brain volume
      ex vacuo ventriculomegaly dysgenesis of corpus callosum white matter abnormalities
      ranging from non-specific changes to leukodystrophy). Swallowing difficulties
      respiratory insufficiency osteoporosis and variable craniofacial dysmorphisms
      (including plagio/brachycephaly bitemporal narrowing high-arched eyebrows high
      nasal bridge anteverted nares high palate tented upper lip) may constitute additional
      clinical features.
