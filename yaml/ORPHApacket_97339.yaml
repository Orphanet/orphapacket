  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurovascular malformation characterized by massive dilation
      of one or more dural sinuses typically associated with arteriovenous shunts.
      Anatomic types are the lateral type involving the jugular bulb which presents
      with minimal symptoms and the usually symptomatic midline type involving the
      confluens sinuum (torcular Herophili) and adjacent posterior sinuses. Complications
      include sinus thrombosis venous infarction and cerebral hemorrhage as well as
      cardiac failure macrocrania and hydrocephalus. Spontaneous regression of the
      malformation may occur.
