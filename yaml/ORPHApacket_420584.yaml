  TextSection:
    Contents: Postaxial polydactyly-anterior pituitary anomalies-facial dysmorphism
      syndrome is a rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder
      characterized primarily by congenital hypopituitarism and/or postaxial polydactyly.
      It can be associated with short stature delayed bone age hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
      and/or midline facial defects (e.g. hypotelorism mild midface hypoplasia flat
      nasal bridge and cleft lip and/or palate). Hypoplastic anterior pituitary and
      ectopic posterior pituitary lobe are frequent findings on MRI examination.
