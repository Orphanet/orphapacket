  TextSection:
    Contents: Cerebellar ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome is a very rare autosomal recessive
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the combination of progressive cerebellar
      ataxia with onset from early childhood to the fourth decade and hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadism (delayed puberty and lack of secondary sex characteristics). Cerebellar
      ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome belongs to a clinical continuum of neurodegenerative
      disorders along with clinically overlapping disorders such as ataxia-hypogonadism-choroidal
      dystrophy syndrome (see this term).
