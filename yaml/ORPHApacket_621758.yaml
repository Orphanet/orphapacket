  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare interstitial lung disease characterized by early-onset severe
      progressive lung disease manifesting by respiratory distress neurological symptoms
      including axial hypotonia developmental delay irritability dystonia poor visual
      contact and seizures and variable multisystemic involvement including malabsorption
      progressive growth failure recurrent infections chronic hemolytic anemia and
      liver dysfunction. Kidney dysfunction cardiac involvement including cardiomegaly
      and cardiac hypertrophy decreased vision and strabismus have also been reported.
      Lung fibrosis may cause death in infancy from respiratory failure.
