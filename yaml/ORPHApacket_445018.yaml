  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary immunodeficiency characterized by early onset
      of recurrent respiratory infections and variable combination of autoimmune disorders
      including hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenic purpura lymphoproliferative disease
      inflammatory bowel disease colitis diabetes arthritis and dermatitis. Failure
      to thrive hepatosplenomegaly and endocrine abnormalities have also been associated.
      Variable immunologic findings include deficiency of CD4+ T regulatory cells
      decreased B-cells and hypogammaglobulinemia.
