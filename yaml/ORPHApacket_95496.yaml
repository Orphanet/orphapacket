  TextSection:
    Contents: Pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (PSIS) is a congenital abnormality
      of the pituitary that is responsible for pituitary deficiency and is usually
      characterized by the triad of a very thin or interrupted pituitary stalk an
      ectopic (or absent) posterior pituitary (EPP) and hypoplasia or aplasia of the
      anterior pituitary visible on MRI. In some patients the abnormality may be limited
      to EPP (also called ectopic neurohypophysis) or to an interrupted pituitary
      stalk.
