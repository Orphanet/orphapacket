  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized by the onset
      of slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness during childhood (with fatigue
      and difficulty running and climbing stairs) and developmental delay. Mild intellectual
      deficit and microcephaly without any obvious structural brain abnormality are
      found in all patients. Mild pseudohypertrophy and joint contractures of the
      ankles have also been reported.
