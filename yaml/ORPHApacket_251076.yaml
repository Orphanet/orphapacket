  TextSection:
    Contents: 8p23.1 duplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from the partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 8 with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by mild to moderate developmental
      delay intellectual disability mild facial dysmorphism (incl. prominent forehead
      arched eyebrows broad nasal bridge upturned nares cleft lip and/or palate) and
      congenital cardiac anomalies (e.g. atrioventricular septal defect). Other reported
      features include macrocephaly behavioral abnormalities (e.g. attention deficit
      disorder) seizures hypotonia and ocular and digital anomalies (poly/syndactyly).
