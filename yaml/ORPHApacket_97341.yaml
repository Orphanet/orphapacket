  TextSection:
    Contents: Persistent placoid maculopathy is characterised by white plaque-like
      lesions involving the macula but sparing the peripapillary areas of both eyes.
      It has been described in five patients. In contrast to patients with macular
      serpiginous choroiditis presenting with similar lesions the five patients reported
      so far with persistent placoid maculopathy had good visual acuity until the
      onset of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or pigmentary mottling. The macular
      lesions fade after several months or years but the vascular anomalies persist
      leading to a loss of central vision.
