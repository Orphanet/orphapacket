    Contents: Superficial siderosis is a rare neurologic disease characterized by
      progressive sensorineural hearing loss cerebellar ataxia pyramidal signs and
      neuroimaging findings revealing hemosiderin deposits in the spinal and cranial
      leptomeninges and subpial layer. The disease progresses slowly and patients
      may present with mild cognitive impairment nystagmus dysmetria spasticity dysdiadochokinesia
      dysarthria hyperreflexia and Babinski signs. Additional features reported include
      dementia urinary incontinence anosmia ageusia and anisocoria.
