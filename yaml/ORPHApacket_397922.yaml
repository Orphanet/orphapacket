  TextSection:
    Contents: Ferro-cerebro-cutaneous syndrome is a rare genetic metabolic liver disease
      characterized by progressive neurodegeneration cutaneous abnormalities including
      varying degrees of ichthyosis or seborrheic dermatitis and systemic iron overload.
      Patients manifest with infantile-onset seizures encephalopathy abnormal eye
      movements axial hypotonia with peripheral hypertonia brisk reflexes cortical
      blindness and deafness myoclonus and hepato/splenomegaly as well as oral manifestations
      including microdontia widely spaced and pointed teeth with delayed eruption
      and gingival overgrowth.
