  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked intellectual disability Siderius type is characterised by mild
      to borderline intellectual deficit associated with cleft lip/palate. Preaxial
      polydactyly large hands and cryptorchidism are sometimes present. The syndrome
      has been described in seven boys from two families. Transmission is X-linked
      and the syndrome is caused by mutations in the <i>PHF8</i> gene localised to
      the p11.21 region of the X chromosome.
