  TextSection:
    Contents: PPoma is a type of pancreatic endocrine tumor (see this term) that hypersecretes
      pancreatic polypeptide (PP) but that does not cause a hypersecretion syndrome
      (is non-functioning) and instead presents with only non-specific symptoms such
      as weight loss abdominal pain jaundice diarrhea and/or an abdominal mass hence
      leading to a late diagnosis. PPoma can be associated with multiple endocrine
      neoplasia 1 (MEN-1; see this term).
