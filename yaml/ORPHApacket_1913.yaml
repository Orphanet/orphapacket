  TextSection:
    Contents: A drug-related embryofetopathy that can occur when an embryo/fetus is
      exposed to trimethadione and that is characterized by pre- and post-natal growth
      retardation intellectual deficit developmental and speech delay craniofacial
      anomalies (with some similarities to those seen in fetal valproate syndrome)
      and less commonly cleft palate malformations of the heart urogenital system
      and limbs. Trimethadione is an antiepileptic drug that has been removed from
      the market in Europe and is no longer used much in other countries due to teratogenicity
      and potential side effects.
