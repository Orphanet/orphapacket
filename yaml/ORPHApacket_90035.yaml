  TextSection:
    Contents: Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a very rare subtype of autoimmune
      hemolytic anemia (AIHA see this term) caused by the presence of cold-reacting
      autoantibodies in the blood and characterized by the sudden presence of hemoglobinuria
      typically after exposure to cold temperatures.
