  TextSection:
    Contents: Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a very rare subtype of autoimmune
      hemolytic anemia (AIHA) caused by the presence of cold-reacting autoantibodies
      in the blood and characterized by the sudden presence of hemoglobinuria typically
      after exposure to cold temperatures.
