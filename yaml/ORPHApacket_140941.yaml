    Contents: Short stature due to primary acid-labile subunit (ALS) deficiency is
      characterized by moderate postnatal growth deficit markedly low circulating
      levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor
      binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) and hyperinsulinemia in the absence of growth hormone
      (GH) deficiency or GH insensitivity.
