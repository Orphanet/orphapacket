  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare metabolic liver disease characterized by progressive liver disease
      and early cirrhosis due to accumulation of toxic cholesterol metabolites which
      are detectable in bile plasma and urine in association with dental abnormalities
      such as general hypomineralization and enamel hypoplasia as well as occurrence
      of supernumerary teeth. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1996.
