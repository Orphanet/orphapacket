  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital laryngeal palsy is a rare larynx anomaly characterized by
      unilateral or bilateral paralysis of the vocal cords as a result of dysfunction
      of the motor nerve supply to the larynx. Patients typically present at birth
      (or shortly thereafter) with stridor weak or breathy cry dysphonia or aphonia
      feeding or aspiration difficulties and occasionally respiratory compromise.
      Neurological disease masses that cause compression and aberrant vessels are
      often associated. Most cases resolve spontaneously over 6-12 months.
