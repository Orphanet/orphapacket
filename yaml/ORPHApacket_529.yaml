  TextSection:
    Contents: Roch-Leri mesosomatous lipomatosis is a rare benign autosomal dominant
      disorder of fat tissue proliferation characterized by the presence of multiple
      small lipomas of 2 to 5 cm in diameter in the middle third of the body (i.e.
      the forearms trunk and upper thighs) and which are generally painless and can
      be easily removed by local anesthesia provided that they are not too numerous
      or confluent. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1984.
