  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chromosome Y structural anomaly with a highly variable phenotype
      mostly characterized by short stature partial to total gonadal failure sexual
      infantilism genital anomalies (e.g. ambiguous genitalia hypospadias cryptorchidism)
      and azoospermia or oligozoospermia. Additional reported features include speech
      delay obesity and acanthosis nigricans. Gender dysphoria and comorbid bipolar
      disorder have also been observed.
