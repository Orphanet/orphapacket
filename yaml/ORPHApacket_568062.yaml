  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary lymphedema characterized by uniform widespread
      lymphedema often with systemic involvement such as intestinal and pulmonary
      lymphangiectasia pleural and pericardial effusions and chylothorax. There is
      a high incidence of non-immune hydrops fetalis which may result in fetal demise
      or fully resolve after birth. Severe recurrent facial cellulitis is observed
      in some patients. Presence of epicanthic folds or micrognathia has occasionally
      been reported while intelligence is normal and seizures are absent.
