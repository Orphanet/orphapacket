  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hyaline fibromatosis syndrome characterized by papulo-nodular
      skin lesions (especially around the head and neck) soft tissue masses gingival
      hypertrophy joint contractures and osteolytic bone lesions in variable degrees.
      Joint contractures may cripple patients and delay normal motor development if
      occuring in infancy. Severe gingival hyperplasia can interfere with eating and
      delay dentition. Histopathology analysis of involved tissues reveals cords of
      spindle-shaped cells embedded in an amorphous hyaline material.
