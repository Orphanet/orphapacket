  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic odontologic disease characterized by failure of eruption
      of non-ankylosed permanent teeth without evidence of obvious mechanical obstruction.
      Posterior teeth are preferentially affected (typically with involvement of all
      teeth distal to the most mesial non-erupted tooth) resulting in a posterior
      open bite. Non-ankylosed teeth tend to become ankylosed and orthodontic treatment
      of affected teeth is generally unsuccessful.
