  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by increased levels of
      estrogen due to elevated extraglandular aromatase activity. Males present with
      heterosexual precocious puberty which manifests with pre- or peripubertal onset
      of gynecomastia premature growth spurt accelerated bone maturation resulting
      in decreased adult stature and may present mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
      Female patients may have isosexual precocious puberty or not have any manifestations
      at all.
