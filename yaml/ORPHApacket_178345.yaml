    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by increased levels of

      heterosexual precocious puberty which manifests with pre- or peripubertal onset
      of gynecomastia premature growth spurt accelerated bone maturation resulting
      in decreased adult stature and may present mild hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
