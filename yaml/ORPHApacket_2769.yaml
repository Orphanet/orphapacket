  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial osteodysplasia Anderson type is a rare genetic dysostosis disorder
      characterized by craniofacial bone abnormalities (i.e. midface hypoplasia broad
      flat nasal bridge narrow thin prognathic mandible with pointed chin malocclusion
      partial dental agenesis) associated with additional osseous anomalies including
      scoliosis calvarial thinning pointed spinous processes clinodactyly and abnormal
      phalanges. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate hyperuricemia and hypertension
      have also been reported. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1982.
