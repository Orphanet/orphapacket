  TextSection:
    Contents: Mucolipidosis type III gamma (ML 3 gamma) is a very rare lysosomal disease
      that has most often been observed in the Middle East characterized by a progressive
      slowing of the growth rate in early childhood; stiffness and pain in shoulders
      hips and finger joints; a gradual mild coarsening of facial features; and by
      a slower progression milder clinical course and longer life expectancy than
      that seen in mucolipidosis type II and mucolipidosis type III alpha/beta. Cognitive
      function is normal or only slightly impaired and retinitis pigmentosa has been
      reported in a few patients. Many survive into early adulthood but ultimately
      succumb to cardiorespiratory insufficiency.
