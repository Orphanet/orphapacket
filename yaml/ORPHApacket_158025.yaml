    Contents: Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare benign non-Langerhans
      cell histiocytosis characterized by childhood or adolescence onset of multiple
      small asymptomatic slowly progressing skin-colored to red-brown papules with
      predilection for the face dorsal hands forearms and legs without associated
      mucosal or visceral involvement. Histologically papules are well-circumscribed
      unencapsulated nodular aggregates of histiocytes with abundant mucin in the
      upper and middermis.
