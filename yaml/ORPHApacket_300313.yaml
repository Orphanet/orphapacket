    Contents: Congenital cataract-hearing loss-severe developmental delay syndrome
      is a rare genetic lethal neurometabolic disease characterized by congenital
      cataracts sensorineural hearing loss severe psychomotor developmental delay
      severe generalized muscular hypotonia and central nervous system abnormalities
      (incl. cerebellar and cerebral hypoplasia hypomyelination wide subarachnoid
      spaces) in the presence of low serum copper and ceruloplasmin. Nystagmus and
      seizures have also been reported.
