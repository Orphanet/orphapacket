  TextSection:
    Contents: Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HSP) is a multi-system disorder characterized
      by oculocutaneous albinism bleeding diathesis and in some cases neutropenia
      pulmonary fibrosis or granulomatous colitis. HPS comprises eight known disorders
      (HPS-1 to HPS-8) the majority of which present with the same clinical phenotype
      to varying degrees of severity.
