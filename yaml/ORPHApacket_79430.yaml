  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multi-system disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism
      bleeding diathesis and in some cases neutropenia pulmonary fibrosis or granulomatous
      colitis. The clinical subtypes of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) often present
      the same clinical phenotype but have different associated complications with
      varying degrees of severity.
