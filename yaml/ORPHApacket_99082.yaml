  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare aortic arch defect characterized by variable degrees of dysphagia
      due to compression of the esophagus from an aberrant right subclavian artery
      (arteria lusoria) which arises as the fourth branch distal to the left subclavian
      artery from the aortic arch. In most cases the aberrant vessel then passes posterior
      to the esophagus less frequently between the trachea and esophagus or anterior
      to the trachea. Children may also present with stridor and recurrent chest infections.
