  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare infantile epilepsy syndrome characterized by infancy-onset of
      myoclonic seizures in otherwise neurologically and developmentally normal patients.
      Jerks may vary in severity can be singular or occur in a series and occur spontaneously
      or (less commonly) after sensory stimuli. Seizures are self-limiting and remit
      within several months to years from onset although generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures or other forms of epilepsy may be seen later in life. Developmental
      delay and cognitive and behavioral difficulties have been reported in a considerable
      percentage of patients.
