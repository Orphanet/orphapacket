    Contents: Juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE) is a genetic epilepsy with onset occurring
      around puberty. JAE is characterized by sporadic occurrence of absence seizures
      frequently associated with a long-life prevalence of generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures (GTCS) and sporadic myoclonic jerks.
