  TextSection:
    Contents: Ovarian fibrothecoma is a rare benign sex cord-stromal neoplasm with
      a typically unilateral location in the ovary characterized by mixed features
      of both fibroma and thecoma. Patients may be asymptomatic or may present with
      pelvic/abdominal pain and/or distension and occasionally with post-menopausal
      bleeding. Large tumors (>10cm) are often associated with pleural effusion and
      ascites (the Meigs syndrome triad).
