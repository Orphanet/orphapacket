  TextSection:
    Contents: Gemignani syndrome is a rare neurodegenerative disease characterized
      by slowly progressive ataxia amyotrophy of the hands and distal arms spastic
      paraplegia progressive sensorineural hearing loss hypogonadism and short stature.
      Additional features include generalized cerebellar atrophy and peripheral nervous
      system anomalies. Small cervical spinal cord intellectual/language disability
      and localized vitiligo have also been reported. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1989.
