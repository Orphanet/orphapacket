  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A group of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas characterized by the indolent
      slow progression of patches plaques and tumors. There are four known variants:
      classic mycosis fungoides folliculotropic mycosis fungoides localized pagetoid
      reticulosis and granulomatous slack skin. Classic MF is characterized by slow
      progression from patches on sun-protracted areas to more infiltrated plaques
      and tumors; folliculotropic MF preferentially involves the head and neck region;
      localized pagetoid reticulosis shows localized patches or plaques usually involving
      one extremity; granulomatous slack skin is extremely rare and characterized
      by the presence of circumscribed areas of pendulous lax skin.'
