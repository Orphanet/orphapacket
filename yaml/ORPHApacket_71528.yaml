  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by early onset of severe
      intractable diarrhea and intestinal malabsorption followed by obesity and hormonal
      deficiencies due to insufficient activation of several prohormones resulting
      in hypocortisolism hypothyroidism diabetes insipidus hypogonadism growth deficiency
      and diabetes mellitus. Extent and age of onset of hormone deficiencies are variable
      between patients.
