  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation syndrome characterized by a highly
      variable combination of congenital anomalies of the femur fibula and/or ulna
      which can appear along with finger/toe anomalies at the ulnar/fibular side.
      Limb defects are asymmetrical with upper limbs more often affected than lower
      limbs and the right side of the body more often affected than the left. Abnormalities
      of the upper limb include amelia hypoplasia of the humerus humero-radial synostosis
      and malformation of the ulna and ulnar rays. Abnormalities of the lower limb
      include absence of the proximal part of the femur and absence of the fibula.
      Axial skeleton internal organs and intellectual function are usually normal.
