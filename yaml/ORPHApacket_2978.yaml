  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare and heterogeneous gastroenterological clinical syndrome characterized
      by recurrent symptoms of intestinal obstruction with radiological features of
      dilated small or large intestine in absence of any mechanical occlusive lesion.
      Permanent alterations in neural muscular or mesenchymal structures of the intestinal
      wall or its extrinsic neural control chronically impair tonic and propulsive
      motor functions in one or more segments of the gut.
