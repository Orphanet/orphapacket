  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare 46,XY disorder of gonadal development characterized by congenital
      complete absence of testicular tissue in an individual with an otherwise normal
      male phenotype and normal karyotype. In addition a small penis is a frequent
      finding in anorchid patients. Typical hormonal characteristics are elevated
      basal levels of gonadotropins (especially FSH) low concentration of testosterone
      and lack of increase of plasma testosterone in response to hCG administration.
      The GnRH stimulation test induces a prolonged increase in FSH and LH levels.
