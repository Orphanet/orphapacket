    Contents: White forelock with malformations is a multiple congenital anomalies
      syndrome characterized by poliosis distinct facial features (epicanthal folds
      hypertelorism posterior rotation of ears prominent philtrum high-arched palate)
      and congenital anomalies/malformations of the eye (blue sclera) cardiopulmonary
      (atrial septal defect prominent thoracic and abdominal veins) and skeletal (clinodactyly
      syndactyly of the fingers and 2nd and 3rd toes) systems. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1980.
