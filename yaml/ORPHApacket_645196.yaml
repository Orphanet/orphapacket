  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dysraphic abnormality characterized by a persistent connection
      between the neural tissue and overlying skin. The stalk-like connection consists
      of a fibroneural tract (mainly composed of fibrous attenuated mesenchymal tissue
      and neural elements without an epithelial lining) connecting the skin lesion
      to the underlying dorsal surface of the spinal cord. Fibroneural stalk varies
      in thickness and complexity and they pass through the deep fascia a bifid lamina/
      the interspinous ligament and the dura. It can be associated with filum anomaly.
      Chiari II malformation is not present.
