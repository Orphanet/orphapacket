  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia similar to a hydatidiform
      mole but with deep invasion into the myometrium and histologically characterized
      by hyperplasia of trophoblasts generalized cystic degeneration of chorionic
      villi and the presence of molar villi in the myometrium and/ or uterine blood
      vessels. Indicative signs include persistent unexplained metrorrhagia or secondary
      increase stagnation or non-normalization at 6 months of total serum chorionic
      gonadotropin (hCG) levels after evacuation of a hydatidiform mole. Metastases
      (in the lungs or vagina) may be observed.
