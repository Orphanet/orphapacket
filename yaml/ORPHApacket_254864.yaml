  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a potentially life-threatening severe myopathy manifesting in the neonatal
      to early infantile period followed by marked spontaneous improvement of muscular
      function by early childhood. Associated biochemical findings include lactic
      acidosis and a transient marked decrease in respiratory chain activity.
