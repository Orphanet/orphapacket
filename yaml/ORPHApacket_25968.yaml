  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare childhood-onset epilepsy syndrome characterized by photic-induced
      focal occipital seizures in individuals with normal development. It typically
      begins in childhood or adolescence. Seizures are often photic-induced and involve
      visual auras (such as colored spots or lights) followed by involuntary deviation
      of the head and without loss of awareness. The severity and frequency of the
      seizures varies among affected individuals. There is no major impact on developmental
      skills.
