  TextSection:
    Contents: Benign occipital epilepsy is a rare genetic neurological disorder characterized
      by visual seizures and occipital epileptiform paroxysms reactive to ocular opening
      which present in infancy to mid-adolescence. Vomiting tonic eye deviation and
      impairment of consciousness are typically associated with the Panayiotopoulos
      type while visual hallucinations ictal blindness and post-ictal headache are
      commonly observed in the Gastaut type. Electroencephalographic findings in both
      types are similar and include bilateral synchronous high voltage spike-wave
      complexes in a normal background activity located predominantly in the occipital
      lobes.
