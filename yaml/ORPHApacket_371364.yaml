  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypotonia-speech impairment-severe cognitive delay syndrome is a rare
      genetic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe persistent hypotonia
      (presenting at birth or in early infancy) severe global developmental delay
      (with poor or absent speech difficulty or inability to roll sit or walk) profound
      intellectual disability and failure to thrive. Additional manifestations include
      microcephaly progressive peripheral spasticity bilateral strabismus and nystagmus
      constipation and variable dysmorphic facial features (including plagiocephaly
      broad forehead small nose low-set ears micrognathia and open mouth with tented
      upper lip).
