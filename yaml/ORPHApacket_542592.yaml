  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized by enlarging annular plaques with
      red-brown edges and atrophic yellow-brown telangiectatic centers. The lesions
      are commonly asymptomatic but affected skin areas may be fragile and painful
      ulcerations develop in many cases. In rare cases development of squamous cell
      carcinoma within longstanding lesions has been reported. The lower legs especially
      the shins are the most frequently involved site. The condition is often associated
      with diabetes mellitus.
