  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by increased susceptibility
      to infections with <i>candida albicans</i> and weakly pathogenic mycobacteria
      such as <i>mycobacterium bovis</i>. Patients present in infancy with chronic
      mucocutaneous candidiasis of varying severity disseminated mycobacterial disease
      absence of palpable axillary and cervical lymph nodes reduced thymus size and
      variable hepatosplenomegaly. The immunological phenotype comprises mild T-cell
      lymphopenia absence of type 1 natural killer T-cells and mucosal-associated
      invariant T-cells and low levels of type 3 innate lymphoid cells.
