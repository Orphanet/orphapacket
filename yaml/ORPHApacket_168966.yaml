  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lymphoma characterized by the concurrent occurrence of two or
      more histologic types of lymphoma involving the same anatomic site. Composite
      lymphomas can be combinations of two non-Hodgkin lymphomas or of a non-Hodgkin
      and a Hodgkin lymphoma. In many cases the tumors are clonally related. Clinical
      presentation and treatment are determined by the more aggressive component.
