  TextSection:
    Contents: Chudley-McCullough syndrome is a rare genetic syndromic deafness characterized
      by severe to profound bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (congenital or rapidly
      progressive in infancy) associated with a complex brain malformation including
      hydrocephalus varying degrees of partial corpus callosum agenesis colpocephaly
      cerebral and cerebellar cortical dysplasia (bilateral medial frontal polymicrogyria
      bilateral frontal subcortical heteropia) and in some arachnoid cysts. Major
      physical abnormalities or psychomotor delay are usually not associated.
