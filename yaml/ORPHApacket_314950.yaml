  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hypereosinophilic syndrome characterized by hypereosinophilia
      produced by clonal eosinophils derived from neoplastic stem cells in the absence
      of any secondary cause of eosinophilia and persisting for at least six months.
      The condition is associated with signs of organ infiltration dysfunction and
      damage. Clinical manifestations are highly variable depending on the organ systems
      involved and include dermatologic pulmonary cardiac gastrointestinal and cerebral
      manifestations among others.
