  TextSection:
    Contents: Hemolytic anemia due to pyrimidine 5' nucleotidase deficiency is a rare
      hereditary hemolytic anemia due to an erythrocyte nucleotide metabolism disorder
      characterized by mild to moderate hemolytic anemia associated with basophilic
      stippling and the accumulation of high concentrations of pyrimidine nucleotides
      within the erythrocyte. Patients present with variable features of jaundice
      splenomegaly hepatomegaly gallstones and sometimes require transfusions. Rare
      cases of mild development delay and learning difficulties are reported.
