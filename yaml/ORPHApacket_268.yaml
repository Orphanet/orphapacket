  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by an onset in late adolescence or early adulthood of slowly progressive proximal
      weakness and atrophy of shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. Cardiac and respiratory
      muscles are not involved. Hypertrophy of the calf muscles and highly elevated
      serum creatine kinase levels are frequently observed.
