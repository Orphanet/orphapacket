    Contents: A rare pure or complex subtype of hereditary spastic paraplegia with
      highly variable phenotype typically characterized by childhood-onset of minimally
      progressive bilateral mainly symmetric lower limb spasticity and weakness associated
      with pes cavus diminished vibration sense sphincter disturbances and/or urinary
      bladder hyperactivity. Additional associated manifestations may include scoliosis
      mild intellectual disability optic atrophy axonal motor neuropathy and/or distal
      amyotrophy.
