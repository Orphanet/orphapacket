  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia with variable
      phenotype typically characterized by childhood-onset of minimally progressive
      bilateral mainly symmetric lower limb spasticity and weakness associated with
      <i>pes cavus</i> scoliosis sphincter disturbances and/or urinary bladder hyperactivity.
      Rare additional associated manifestations may include mild intellectual disability
      axonal motor neuropathy and seizures.
