      of eggs or larvae of the ascarids <i>Toxocara canis</i> or <i>Toxocara cati</i>
      the common round worm of dogs and cats respectively. The infestation can be
      asymptomatic or can present as visceral larva migrans caused by larval migration

      with fever cough hepatomegaly pneumonia or rarely encephalitis) or as ocular
      larva migrans caused by larval migration to the eye (manifesting as ocular inflammation
