  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary germ cell tumor of central nervous system characterized
      by a space-occupying lesion usually arising in structures around the third ventricle
      most commonly the region of the pineal gland and the suprasellar compartment.
      It is composed of uniform cells resembling primitive germ cells. Clinical manifestations
      depend on the tumor site and include hydrocephalus visual disturbances and endocrine
      abnormalities. Prognosis is favorable in pure germinomas due to high radiosensitivity.
