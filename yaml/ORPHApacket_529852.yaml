  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hepatic tumor characterized by the presence of both hepatocytic
      and cholangiocytic differentiation within a primary liver carcinoma. The lesion
      commonly arises in the context of chronic liver disease (such as hepatitis B
      or C or steatohepatitis) or exposure to a variety of exogenous agents. Patients
      may present with signs and symptoms related to the tumor as well as to the underlying
      condition. Typical manifestations include right upper quadrant abdominal pain
      weight loss hepatosplenomegaly jaundice and ascites. The entity has been associated
      with a worse prognosis than hepatocellular carcinoma after resection.
