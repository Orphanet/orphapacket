  TextSection:
    Contents: Giant adenofibroma of the breast is a rare benign fibroepithelial tumor
      which usually manifests as a unilateral painless firm mobile slow-growing mass
      in the breast that measures more than 5 cm. It can be associated with significant
      asymmetry and/or deformity of the breast and hormonal changes (e.g. puberty
      pregnancy oral contraceptives) can lead to its marked enlargement.
