  TextSection:
    Contents: Exstrophy-Epispadias Complex (EEC) represents a spectrum of genitourinary
      malformations ranging in severity from epispadias (E) and classical bladder
      exstrophy (CEB) to exstrophy of the cloaca (EC) as the most severe form (see
      these terms). Depending on severity the EEC may involve the urinary system the
      musculoskeletal system the pelvis the pelvic floor the abdominal wall the genitalia
      and sometimes the spine and the anus.
