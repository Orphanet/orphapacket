    Contents: 'A rare X-linked inherited form of syndromic microphthalmia characterized
      by unilateral or bilateral microphthalmia (and/or clinical anophthalmia) with
      or without coloboma in addition to a range of extraocular manifestations such
      as microcephaly malformed ears dental abnormalities (i.e. irregular shape of
