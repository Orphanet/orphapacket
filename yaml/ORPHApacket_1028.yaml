    Contents: A rare ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by the association
      of hypocalcified and hypoplastic tooth enamel distal finger and toenail onycholysis
      with subungueal hyperkeratosis and functional hypohidrosis. Additional manifestations
      include seborrheic scalp dermatitis and rough dry skin. Lacrymal punctae may
