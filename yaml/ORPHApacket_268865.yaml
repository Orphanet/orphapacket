    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic malformation of neurenteric canal spinal
      cord and column characterized by intraspinal predominantly intradural-extramedullary
      cystic mass located typically ventral to the spinal cord. Histopathology reveals
      columnar or cuboidal epithelium with or without cilia and mucus globules. Patients
      may be asymptomatic or present with signs and symptoms of compression of the
      spinal cord and associated nerve roots such as focal weakness progressive paresis
      paresthesias gait disturbance or radicular pain. Concomitant congenital vertebral
      anomalies are frequently observed.
