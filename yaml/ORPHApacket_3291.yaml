  TextSection:
    Contents: Teebi-Shaltout syndrome is a rare genetic development defect during
      embryogenesis malformation syndrome characterized by association of characteristic
      facial features (including abnormal head shape with narrow forehead hypertelorism
      telecanthus small earlobes broad nasal bridge and tip underdeveloped ala nasi
      small/wide mouth and high/cleft palate) ectodermal dysplasia (including oligodontia
      with delayed dentition slow growing hair and reduced sweating) and skeletal
