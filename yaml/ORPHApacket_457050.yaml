  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder due to nuclear
      DNA anomalies characterized by onset of slowly progressive proximal lower limb
      weakness and exercise intolerance in the first decade of life followed by weakness
      of neck flexor shoulder and distal leg muscles. Facial muscles become involved
      still later in the disease course. Additional manifestations are restrictive
      pulmonary function and short stature. Laboratory studies reveal lactic acidemia
      and increased serum creatine kinase.
