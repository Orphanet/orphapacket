  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogenosis due to glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) deficiency or glycogen
      storage disease (GSD) type 1 is a group of inherited metabolic diseases including
      types a and b (see these terms) and characterized by poor tolerance to fasting
      growth retardation and hepatomegaly resulting from accumulation of glycogen
      and fat in the liver.
