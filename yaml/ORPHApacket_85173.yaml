  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by intrauterine growth restriction
      metaphyseal dysplasia congenital adrenal hypoplasia and genital anomalies (such
      as cryptorchidism posterior hypospadias and micropenis). Patients may present
      shortly after birth with severe adrenal insufficiency. Additional manifestations
      include postnatal growth failure and delayed bone age mild developmental delay
      macrocephaly mild facial dysmorphism (with frontal bossing wide nasal bridge
      and small low-set ears) epiphyseal dysplasia and hypercalcemia/hypercalciuria
      among others.
