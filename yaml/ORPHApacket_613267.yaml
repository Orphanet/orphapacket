  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia characterized by infantile onset
      of severe global developmental delay with absent speech hypotonia feeding problems
      dysmorphic craniofacial features and development of pontocerebellar hypoplasia
      on brain imaging later in childhood. Other structural abnormalities of the brain
      which may already be apparent at an earlier stage include small hippocampus
      thin corpus callosum periventricular white matter abnormalities and Dandy-Walker
      malformation. Seizures nystagmus and cortical visual impairment have been reported
      in some cases.
