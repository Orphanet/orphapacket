    Contents: A form of pontocerebellar hypoplasia characterized by infantile onset
      of severe global developmental delay with absent speech hypotonia feeding problems
      dysmorphic craniofacial features and development of pontocerebellar hypoplasia
      on brain imaging later in childhood. Other structural abnormalities of the brain
      which may already be apparent at an earlier stage include small hippocampus
