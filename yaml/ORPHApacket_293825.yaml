  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) characterized by
      ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis that leads to severe anemia at birth
      requiring repeated transfusions. The majority of affected individuals experience
      severe hemolytic anemia often accompanied by a normal or slightly elevated reticulocyte
      count hepatosplenomegaly hyperbilirubinemia and persistence of fetal hemoglobin.
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and occasional dysmorphic features including large
      anterior fontanel hypertelorism micropenis and hypospadias have also been reported.
      All documented cases to date share the same dominant-negative missense variant
      E325K in the <i>KLF1</i> gene (19p13.2).
