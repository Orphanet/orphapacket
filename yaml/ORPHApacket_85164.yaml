  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptodactyly-tall stature-scoliosis-hearing loss syndrome is characterised
      by camptodactyly tall stature scoliosis and hearing loss (CATSHL). It has been
      described in around 30 individuals from seven generations of the same family.
      The syndrome is caused by a missense mutation in the FGFR3 gene leading to a
      partial loss of function of the encoded protein which is a negative regulator
      of bone growth.
