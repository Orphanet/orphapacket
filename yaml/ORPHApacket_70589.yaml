  TextSection:
    Contents: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic respiratory disease that results
      from complications related to lung injury during the treatment of infant acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (see these terms) in low-birth-weight premature
      infants or from abnormal lung development in older infants. Clinical signs are
      tachypnea tachycardia and signs of respiratory distress such as intercostal
      recession grunting and nasal flaring.
