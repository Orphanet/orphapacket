  TextSection:
    Contents: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a chronic respiratory disease that results
      from complications related to lung injury during the treatment of infant acute
      respiratory distress syndrome in low-birth-weight premature infants or from
      abnormal lung development in older infants. Clinical signs are tachypnea tachycardia
      and signs of respiratory distress such as intercostal recession grunting and
      nasal flaring.
