  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital tumor characterized by a benign cyst with epithelial
      and epidermoid components originating from embryologic displacement and ectopic
      growth of ectodermal tissue in the central nervous system. In contrast to epidermoid
      cysts dermoid cysts also contain dermis and skin appendages. Most common location
      is the lumbosacral region as well as the cerebellopontine angle and parasellar
      area for intracranial lesions. Clinical presentation depends on the location
      and size of the tumor and includes pain muscle weakness motor and sensory disturbances
      and incontinence for intraspinal lesions and intracranial hypertension gait
      disturbances cranial nerve dysfunction and visual deficits for intracranial
      tumors. The cysts may rupture and cause chemical meningitis.
