  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary arterial and articular multiple calcification syndrome is
      a very rare genetic vascular disease of autosomal recessive inheritance described
      in less than 20 patients to date characterized by adult-onset (as early as the
      second decade of life) isolated calcification of the arteries of the lower extremities
      (including the iliac femoral and tibial arteries) as well as the capsule joints
      of the fingers wrists ankles and feet and that usually manifests with mild paresthesias
      of the lower extremities intense joint pain and swelling and early onset arthritis
      of affected joints.
