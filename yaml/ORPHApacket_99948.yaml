  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4A (CMT4A) is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease type 4 characterized by early-onset (infancy to early childhood) of
      severe rapidly progressing demyelinating axonal or intermediate sensorimotor
      neuropathy usually affecting first and more severely the distal lower extremities
      and later the proximal muscles and upper extremities. Nerve conduction velocities
      range from very slow to normal. Apart from the typical CMT phenotype (distal
      muscle weakness and atrophy sensory loss frequent pes cavus foot deformity)
      patients commonly present delayed motor development vocal cord paresis mild
      sensory loss abolished deep tendon reflexes and skeletal deformities.
