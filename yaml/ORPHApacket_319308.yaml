  TextSection:
    Contents: MiT family translocation renal cell carcinoma (t-RCC) is a rare subtype
      of renal cell carcinoma with recurrent genetic abnormalities harboring rearrangements
      of the <i>TFE3</i> (Xp11 t-RCC) or <i>TFEB</i> [t(6;11) t-RCC] genes. The t(6;11)
      t-RCC has distinctive histologic features of biphasic appearance with larger
      epitheloid and smaller eosinophilic cells. The symptoms are usually non-specific
      and include hematuria flank pain palpable abdominal mass and/or systemic symptoms
      of anemia fatigue and fever.
