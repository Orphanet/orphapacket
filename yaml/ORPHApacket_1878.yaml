  TextSection:
    Contents: A mild subtype of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy
      characterized by slowly progressive proximal muscle weakness and wasting of
      the pelvic and shoulder girdles with onset that usually occurs during the second
      or third decade of life. Clinical presentation is variable and can include calf
      psuedohypertrophy joint contractures scapular winging muscle cramping and/or
      facial and respiratory muscle involvement.
