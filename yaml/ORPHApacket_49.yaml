  TextSection:
    Contents: Penile agenesis is a rare urogenital tract malformation characterized
      by complete congenital absence of the phallus. It is usually accompanied by
      a well-developed scrotum and presence of a skin tag at the anal verge (with
      or without a urethral meatal opening within it). Often other genitourinary (e.g.
      cryptorchidism renal agenesis and dysplasia urinary reflux prostate agenesis)
      as well as non-genitourinary abnormalities (including skeletal and neural disorders
      anal stenosis imperforate anus cardiac defects) are associated.
