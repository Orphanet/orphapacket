  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare glial tumor characterized by a highly aggressive diffusely infiltrative
      pontine lesion generally occurring in children affecting local nerve fiber tracts
      and spreading contiguously to involve adjacent structures but also metastasizing
      within the central nervous system. Patients mostly present with a short history
      of symptoms typically including the classic triad of multiple cranial neuropathies
      long tract signs and ataxia. Signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure
      may present due to obstructive hydrocephalus. Prognosis is poor and not related
      to histological grade.
