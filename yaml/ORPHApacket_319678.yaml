  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Encephalopathy-hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-renal tubular disease syndrome
      is a rare mitochondrial disease due to a defect in coenzyme Q10 biosynthesis
      that manifests with a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms which may include:
      neonatal lactic acidosis global developmental delay tonus disorder seizures
      reduced spontaneous movements ventricular hypertrophy bradycardia renal tubular
      dysfunction with massive lactic acid excretion in urine severe biochemical defect
      of respiratory chain complexes II/III when assayed together and deficiency of
      coenzyme Q10 in skeletal muscle. Cerebral and cerebellar atrophy can be seen
      on magnetic resonance imaging and multiple choroid plexus cysts and symmetrical
      hyperechoic signal alterations in basal ganglia have been observed on ultrasound.'
