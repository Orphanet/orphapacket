    Contents: A rare pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized
      by either a pure spastic paraplegia phenotype usually presenting in the first

      hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses or as a complicated phenotype with
      the additional manifestations of distal wasting saccadic ocular movements mild
      cerebellar ataxia and mild distal axonal neuropathy.
