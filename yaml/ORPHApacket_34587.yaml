  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease due to LAMP-2 (Lysosomal-Associated Membrane
      Protein 2) deficiency is a lysosomal glycogen storage disease characterised
      by severe cardiomyopathy and variable degrees of muscle weakness frequently
      associated with intellectual deficit.
