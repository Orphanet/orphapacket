  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic cardiac tumor characterized by the presence of a primary
      benign gelatinous mass located in the atria and composed of primitive connective
      tissue cells and stroma (resembling mesenchyme) in several members of a family.
      Clinical presentation depends on the size mobility and location of tumor ranging
      from nonspecific and/or constitutional symptoms to sudden cardiac death and
      includes dyspnea hemoptisis syncope fatigue fever cutaneous rash increases in
      venous pressure and/or peripheral edema.
