  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Purpura fulminans (PF) is a life-threatening rapidly progressive thrombotic
      disorder affecting mainly neonates and children that is characterized by purpuric
      skin lesions and disseminated intravascular coagulation. PF may progress rapidly
      to multi-organ failure caused by thrombotic occlusion of small and medium-sized
      blood vessels. There are two forms of PF that are classified according to triggering
      mechanisms: acute infectious (the most common form) and idiopathic PF.'
