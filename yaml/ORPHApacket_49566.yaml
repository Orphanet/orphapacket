  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A life-threatening rapidly progressive thrombotic disorder affecting
      mainly neonates and children that is characterized by purpuric skin lesions
      and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It may progress rapidly to multi-organ
      failure caused by thrombotic occlusion of small and medium-sized blood vessels.
      There are two forms of the disorder that are classified according to triggering
      mechanisms: acute infectious (the most common form) and idiopathic purpura fulminans.'
