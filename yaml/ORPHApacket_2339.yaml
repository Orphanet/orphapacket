  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized
      by generalized keratosis follicularis severe proportionate dwarfism and cerebral
      atrophy. Alopecia (of scalp eyebrows and eyelashes) and microcephaly are additionally
      observed features. Intellectual disability inguinal hernia and epilepsy may
      also be associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1974.
