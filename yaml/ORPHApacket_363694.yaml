    Contents: Hyperuricemia-pulmonary hypertension-renal failure-alkalosis syndrome
      is a rare genetic mitochondrial disease characterized by early-onset progressive
      renal failure manifesting with hyperuricemia hyponatremia hypomagnesemia hypochloremic
      metabolic alkalosis elevated BUN and polyuria associated with systemic manifestations
      which include pulmonary hypertension failure to thrive global developmental
      delay hypotonia and ventricular hypertrophy. Additional features include prematurity
      elevated serum lactate diabetes mellitus and in some pancytopenia.
