  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by multiple intestinal atresia
      in association with combined immunodeficiency and inflammatory bowel disease.
      Clinical features include widespread atresia extending from the stomach to the
      rectum homogenous calcifications in the abdominal cavity hepatic cholestasis
      cirrhosis and chronic liver failure hypoplastic thymus and increased susceptibility
      to mainly bacteria and viruses. The immunological phenotype consists of profound
      generalized T-cell lymphopenia and milder natural killer cell and B-cell lymphopenia
      as well as low serum levels of IgG IgA and IgM with elevated serum IgE. The
      disease is mostly fatal in infancy or childhood.
