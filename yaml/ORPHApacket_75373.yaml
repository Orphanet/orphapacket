  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic isolated chorioretinal dystrophy characterized by distinctive
      slowly progressing chorioretinal atrophic lesions inducing significant visual
      impairment. There are three clinical stages. Atrophic macular lesion and nasal
      subretinal deposits are evident soon after birth (stage 1) the macular lesions
      progress beyond the retinal vascular arcades and the foci of nasal atrophy coalesce
      into a confluent white lesion (stage 2) and marked expansion of both the macular
      and the nasal atrophic lesions toward the optic disc is observed (stage 3).
      Patients may also present with photophobia nystagmus and myopia.
