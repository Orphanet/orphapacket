    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by a pregnancy complicated
      by polyhydramnios severe intractable epilepsy presenting in infancy severe hypotonia
      decreased muscle mass global developmental delay craniofacial dysmorphism (long
      face large forehead peaked eyebrows broad nasal bridge hypertelorism large mouth
      with thick lips) and macrocephaly due to megalencephaly and hydrocephalus in
      most patients. Additional features that have been reported include cardiac anomalies
      like atrial septal defects diabetes insipidus and nephrocalcinosis among others.
