  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare life-threatening developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized
      by polysyndactyly of fingers and toes as well as complex congenital heart defects
      (e.g. atrioventricular septal defects aortic dextroposition single ventricle
      hypo- or hypertrophy of one side of the heart). Additional features may include
      dysmorphic traits (large fontanel high forehead ptosis hypertelorism epicanthus
      low-set malformed ears prominent root of the nose bulbous nose anteverted nares
      long and smooth philtrum thin upper lip micrognathism hirsutism single transverse
      crease) nail hypoplasia phalange agenesis/hypoplasia flexion contractures polysplenia
      multiple hepatic/renal cysts atrophic biliary vesicle ductal plate malformation
      and genital anomalies (e.g. micropenis undescended testes hypoplastic scrotum).
      The syndrome is usually fatal in utero or in infancy but survival cases have
      been reported.
