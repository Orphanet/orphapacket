  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare organic aciduria characterized by impaired isoleucine degradation
      with increased plasma or whole blood C5 acylcarnitine levels (typically observed
      in newborn screening) and increased urinary excretion of N-methylbutyrylglycine.
      The condition is usually clinically asymptomatic although patients with muscular
      hypotonia developmental delay and seizures (among others) have been reported.
