  TextSection:
    Contents: Hirschsprung disease-type D brachydactyly syndrome is characterized
      by Hirschsprung disease and absence or hypoplasia of the nails and distal phalanges
      of the thumbs and great toes (type D brachydactyly). It has been described in
      four males from one family (two brothers and two maternal uncles). Transmission
      appears to be X-linked recessive but autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete
      penetrance in females can not be ruled out.
