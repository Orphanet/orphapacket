  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral neuropathy disorder due to gain-of-function
      mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels present in the small peripheral nerve
      fibers characterized by neuropathic pain of varying intensity (often beginning
      in the distal extermities and with a burning quality) associated with autonomic
      dysfunction (e.g. orthostatic dizziness palpitations dry eyes and mouth) abnormal
      quantitative sensory testing and reduction in intraepidermal nerve &#64257;ber
      density. Large fiber functions (i.e. normal strength tendon reflexes and vibration
      sense) and nerve conduction studies are typically normal.
