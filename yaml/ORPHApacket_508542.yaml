  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by early-onset progressive bone marrow failure with anemia leukopenia mild thrombopenia
      and myelodysplastic features as well as non-hematologic manifestations such
      as developmental delay cataracts facial dysmorphism short stature and skeletal
      anomalies. Immunodeficiency primarily affects B-cells and may lead to increased
      susceptibility to infections. Additional reported features include dry skin
      and eczema cardiac anomalies hearing loss and reduction of cerebral volume on
      brain imaging.
