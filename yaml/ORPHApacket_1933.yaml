  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by neonatal
      or infantile onset of global developmental delay hypotonia failure to thrive
      progressive neurologic decline sensorineural deafness and movement disorder.
      Seizures external ophthalmoplegia polyneuropathy cardiomyopathy and renal tubular
      dysfunction have also been reported. Brain imaging may show T2-weighted hyperintensities
      in the basal ganglia and laboratory examination may reveal lactic acidosis and
      mild methylmalonic aciduria.
