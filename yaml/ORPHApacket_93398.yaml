  TextSection:
    Contents: Genochondromatosis type 2 is a rare genetic bone development disorder
      characterized by normal clavicles and symmetrical generalized metaphyseal enchondromas
      particularly in the distal femur proximal humerus and bones of the wrists hands
      and feet. Lesions regress later in life with growth cartilage obliteration.
      Clinical examination is normal and the course of the disease is benign.
