  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare glomerular disease histologically characterized by glomerular
      mesangial deposits of IgA often accompanied by IgG and complement C3 as well
      as mesangioproliferative changes clinically mostly manifesting as oligosymptomatic
      glomerulonephritis possibly infection-triggered macrohematuria and a variable
      course ranging from spontaneous remission to slow or rarely rapid progression
      to kidney failure.
