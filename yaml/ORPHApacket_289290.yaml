  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypermethioninemia encephalopathy due to adenosine kinase deficiency
      is a rare inborn error of metabolism disorder characterized by persistent hypermethioninemia
      with increased levels of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine which
      manifests with encephalopathy severe global developmental delay mild to severe
      liver dysfunction hypotonia and facial dysmorphism (most significant is frontal
      bossing macrocephaly hypertelorism and depressed nasal bridge). Epileptic seizures
      hypoglycemia and/or cardiac defects (pulmonary stenosis atrial and/or ventricular
      septal defect coarctation of the aorta) may be associated. Clinical picture
      may range from neurological symptoms only to multi-organ involvement.
