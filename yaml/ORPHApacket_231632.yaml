  TextSection:
    Contents: Ectopic aldosterone-producing tumor is an extremely rare aldosterone-producing
      neoplasm composed of aberrant adrenocortical tissue located outside the adrenal
      glands (e.g. in retroperitoneum perirenal or periaortic fatty tissue thorax
      spinal canal testes ovaries) typically characterized by symptoms related to
      increased aldosterone levels (such as sustained treatment-resistant hypertension
      and hypokalemia) or symptoms caused by local tumor enlargement.
