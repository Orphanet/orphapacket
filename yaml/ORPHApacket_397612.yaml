  TextSection:
    Contents: Macrocephaly-developmental delay syndrome is a rare intellectual disability
      syndrome characterized by macrocephaly mild dysmorphic features (frontal bossing
      long face hooded eye lids with small downslanting palpebral fissures broad nasal
      bridge and prominent chin) global neurodevelopmental delay behavioral abnormalities
      (e.g. anxiety stereotyped movements) and absence or generalized tonic-clonic
      seizures. Additional features reported in some patients include craniosynostosis
      fifth finger clinodactyly recurrent pneumonia and hepatosplenomegaly.
