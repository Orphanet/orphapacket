  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by a childhood to adolescent onset of progressive pelvic- and shoulder-girdle
      muscle weakness particularly affecting the pelvic girdle (adductors and flexors
      of hip). Usually the knees are the earliest and most affected muscles. In advanced
      stages involvement of the shoulder girdle (resulting in scapular winging) and
      the distal muscle groups are observed. Calf hypertrophy cardiomyopathy respiratory
      impairment tendon contractures scoliosis and exercise-induced myoglobinuria
      may be observed.
