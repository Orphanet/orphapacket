  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare monogenic form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus characterized
      by infantile or childhood onset of cold-induced erythematous papules or plaques
      predominantly on the fingers toes nose cheeks and ears. Recurrent ulceration
      of the lesions may lead to necrotic tissue destruction and mutilation. Patients
      may experience ischemia of the affected acral regions. Histological findings
      include cutaneous perivascular inflammatory infiltrates with deposits of immunoglobulins
      or complement.
