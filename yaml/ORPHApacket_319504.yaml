  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 8 is a mitochondrial
      disease due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis resulting in deficiency
      of respiratory chain complexes I III and IV in the cardiac and skeletal muscle
      and brain characterized by severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pulmonary hypoplasia
      generalized muscle weakness and neurological involvement.
