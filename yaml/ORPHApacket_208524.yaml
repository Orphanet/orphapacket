  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare superficial pemphigus disease characterized by severe intractable
      pruritus with erythematous or urticarial plaques and sometimes vesicles organized
      in a herpetiform pattern. Mucosae are generally spared. Eosinophilia in peripheral
      blood and low titers of circulating autoantibodies are observed in many cases.
      Histology can show an aspect of either pemphigus (superficial or deep) or an
      intraepidermal infiltrate rich in eosinophils (eosinophilic spongiosis).
