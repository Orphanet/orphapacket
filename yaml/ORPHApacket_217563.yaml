  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive
      life-threatening refractory respiratory distress in full-term neonates associated
      with surfactant protein B deficiency. In most cases the disease is fatal within
      the first months of life. Lung biopsy reveals changes characteristic of pulmonary
      alveolar proteinosis with interstitial fibrosis and inflammation as well as
      accumulation of lipid-rich eosinophilic proteinaceous granular material consisting
      of desquamated type II pneumocytes and foamy macrophages within the alveolar
      air spaces.
