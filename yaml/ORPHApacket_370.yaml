  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease (GSD) due to phosphorylase kinase deficiency
      is a group of inborn errors of glycogen metabolism that is clinically and genetically
      heterogeneous. This group comprises GSD due to liver phosphorylase kinase (PhK)
      deficiency GSD due to muscle PhK deficiency and GSD due to liver and muscle
      PhK deficiency (see these terms).
