  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus characterized by
      extreme photosensitivity with intermittent formation of erythematous edematous
      urticarial-like smooth plaques on sun-exposed skin areas. The lesions heal without
      scarring. The course of the disease is benign and development of systemic lupus
      erythematosus is infrequent. Most patients do not have lupus-related autoantibodies.
      Skin biopsy shows a perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate and
      increased dermal mucin deposition without involvement of the dermoepidermal
      junction.
