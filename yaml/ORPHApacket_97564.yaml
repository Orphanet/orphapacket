  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis characterized by rapidly progressive
      glomerulonephritis and the absence of antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies
      (ANCA). In comparison with pauci-immune GN with ANCA patients lacking ANCA may
      be younger at onset of the disease have fewer extra renal manifestations (e.g.
      involvement of lung eye ear nose and throat) fewer constitutional symptoms (e.g.
      fever weight loss muscle pain and arthralgia) and a high prevalence of nephrotic
      syndrome and chronic renal lesions. The prognosis is generally poorer.
