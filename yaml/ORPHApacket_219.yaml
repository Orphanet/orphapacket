  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by a variable age of onset of progressive weakness and wasting of the proximal
      skeletal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdles frequently associated with
      progressive respiratory muscle impairment and cardiomyopathy. Calf hypertrophy
      muscle cramps and elevated serum creatine kinase levels are also observed. Neuropsychomotor
      development is usually normal.
