  TextSection:
    Contents: Lung fibrosis-immunodeficiency-46,XX gonadal dysgenesis syndrome is
      characterised by immune deficiency gonadal dysgenesis and fatal lung fibrosis.
      So far it has been described in two sisters born to consanguineous parents.
      Both karyotypes were normal female (46,XX). No genetic anomalies could be identified
      by comparative genome hybridization analysis of their genomes or by analysis
      of genes known to be associated with these types of anomalies.
