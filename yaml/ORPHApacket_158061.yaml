  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hemophagocytic syndrome characterized by excessive activation
      and proliferation of macrophages and T cells occurring in the context of a variety
      of diseases including infections neoplasms rheumatic disorders and leading to
      sudden onset of persistent fever lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Complications
      include profound depression of one or more blood cell lines with coagulopathy
      and pancytopenia and impaired liver and renal function. Bone marrow examination
      reveals numerous well differentiated macrophages actively phagocytosing hematopoietic
      elements.
