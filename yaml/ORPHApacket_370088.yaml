  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic parenchymal hepatic disease characterized by acute liver
      failure that occurs in the first year of life which manifests with failure to
      thrive hypotonia moderate global developmental delay seizures abnormal liver
      function tests microcytic anemia and elevated serum lactate. Other associated
      features include hepatosteatosis and fibrosis abnormal brain morphology and
      renal tubulopathy. Minor illness exacerbates deterioration of liver failure.
