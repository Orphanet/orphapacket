  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare arteriovenous malformation characterized by seizures disabling
      headaches and stroke-like symptoms with progressive neurological deficits due
      to a proliferative response to chronic parenchymal ischaemia. Normal brain parenchyma
      is interspersed throughout the vascular malformation. Hemorrhagic presentations
      are uncommon; however when present the risk of reccurence is higher in such
      patients than in those with classic cerebral arteriovenous malformation.
