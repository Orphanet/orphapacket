  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndrome with a central nervous system malformation as
      a major feature characterized by cortical malformations including posterior
      predominant lissencephaly and diffuse pachygyria as well as midline crossing
      defects thin corpus callosum dysplastic hippocampi narrowing of the brainstem
      with small pons and midbrain widening of the medulla and small cerebellum. Clinically
      patients present global developmental delay severe intellectual disability with
      poor or absent speech axial hypotonia and early-onset seizures among others.
