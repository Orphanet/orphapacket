  TextSection:
    Contents: Spheroid body myopathy is a rare form of myofibrillar myopathy characterized
      by predominantly proximal muscle weakness (that could be either non- or slowly
      progressive) associated with spheroid body inclusions (composed of myofilamentous
      material within individual muscle fibers) in skeletal muscle biopsy. Presentation
      is varied and may range from asymptomatic to severe muscle weakness that manifests
      with absent Achilles reflexes gait abnormality and/or other motor incapacitations.
