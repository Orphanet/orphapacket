    Contents: Peroxisome biogenesis disorders Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD-ZSS)
      is a group of autosomal recessive disorders affecting the formation of functional
      peroxisomes characterized by sensorineural hearing loss pigmentary retinal degeneration
      multiple organ dysfunction and psychomotor impairment and is comprised of the
      phenotypic variants Zellweger syndrome (ZS) neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD)
      and infantile Refsum disease (IRD).
