    Contents: Familial dyskinesia and facial myokymia is a rare paroxysmal movement
      disorder with childhood or adolescent onset characterized by paroxysmal choreiform
      dystonic and myoclonic movements involving the limbs (mostly distal upper limbs)
      neck and/or face which can progressively increase in both frequency and severity
      until they become nearly constant. Patients may also present with delayed motor
