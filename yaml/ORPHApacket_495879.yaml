    Contents: A rare urogenital tract malformation characterized by the complete absence
      of the scrotal rugae in the perineum between the penis and anus with bilateral
      testes being present in a cryptorchid or ectopic position. Hemiscrotal agenesis
      refers to the unilateral absence of scrotal skin with an intact midline raphe
      and ipsilateral cryptorchidism. Both malformations may be isolated findings
      or occur in association with other anomalies.
