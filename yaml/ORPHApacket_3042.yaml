  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability-cataracts-calcified pinnae-myopathy syndrome
      is a rare genetic intellectual disability syndrome characterized by macrocephaly
      hypotonia dysmorphic facial features (wide forehead ptosis downslanting palpebral
      fissures enlarged and calcified external ears large jaw) sparse body hair tall
      stature and intellectual disability. Hearing loss insulin-resistant diabetes
      and progressive distal muscle wasting (leading to joint contractures) have also
      been reported in adulthood. Rare manifestations include behavioral abnormalities
      (aggression and restlessness) hypothyroidism cerebral calcification ataxia and
      peripheral neuropathy.
