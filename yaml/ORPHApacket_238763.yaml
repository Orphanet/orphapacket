    Contents: Glaucoma secondary to spherophakia/ectopia lentis and megalocornea is
      a rare genetic non-syndromic developmental defect of the eye disorder characterized
      by congenital megalocornea associated with spherophakia and/or ectopia lentis
      leading to pupillary block and secondary glaucoma. Additional features may include
      flat irides iridodonesis axial myopia very deep anterior chambers miotic oval
      pupils without well-defined borders ocular pain and irritability manifesting
