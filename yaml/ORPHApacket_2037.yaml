    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      a communication between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk in the presence
      of two normally formed semilunar valves. It may be an isolated finding or occur
      in association with other anomalies. Severe clinical manifestations such as
      congestive heart failure or pulmonary hypertension typically develop in early
      life.
