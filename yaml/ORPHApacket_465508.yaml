  TextSection:
    Contents: Symptomatic form of hemochromatosis type 1 is a rare hereditary hemochromatosis
      characterized by inappropriately regulated intestinal iron absorption which
      leads to excessive iron storage in various organs and manifests with a wide
      range of signs and symptoms including abdominal pain weakness lethargy weight
      loss elevated serum aminotransferase levels increase in skin pigmentation and/or
      arthropathy in the metacarpophalangeal joints. Other commonly associated manifestations
      include hepatomegaly cirrhosis liver fibrosis hepatocellular carcinoma restrictive
      cardiomyopathy and/or diabetes mellitus.
