  TextSection:
    Contents: Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) is a rare form of cutaneous mastocytosis
      (CM; see this term) characterized by generalized erythroderma various degrees
      of blistering skin with a ''peau d'orange'' appearance and the accumulation
      of mast cells in the skin. At least two DCM variants are recognized one with
      extreme blistering (Bullous DCM; see this term) and one with infiltrations (Pseudoxanthomatous
      DCM; see this term).
