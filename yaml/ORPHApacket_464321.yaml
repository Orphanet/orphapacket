  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lymphatic system anomaly characterized by multifocal congenital
      and progressive vascular lesions of the skin gastrointestinal tract and occasionally
      other anatomic sites causing potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenic coagulopathy.
      Macroscopically the lesions appear as round to oval red-brown plaques as large
      as a few centimeters in diameter. Histopathologically they consist of dilated
      thin-walled vessels with variable endothelial hyperplasia positive for lymphatic
      endothelial cell markers and resembling benign lymphangioendothelioma.
