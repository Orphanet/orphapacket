  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptodactyly-taurinuria syndrome is a congenital malformation syndrome
      characterized by the association of a permanent camptodactyly of the fingers
      with the over excretion of taurine in the urine. Camptodactyly mainly affects
      the little finger although any finger may be involved. The disease has been
      described in 17 affected patients from 4 unrelated families. An autosomal dominant
      inheritance has been suggested. There have been no further descriptions in the
      literature since 1966.
