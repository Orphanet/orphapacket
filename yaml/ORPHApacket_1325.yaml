  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptodactyly-taurinuria syndrome is a congenital malformation syndrome
      characterized by the association of a permanent camptodactyly of the fingers
      (see this term) with the over excretion of taurine in the urine. Camptodactyly
      mainly affects the little finger although any finger may be involved. The disease
      has been described in 17 affected patients from 4 unrelated families. An autosomal
      dominant inheritance has been suggested. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1966.
