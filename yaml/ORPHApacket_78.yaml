  TextSection:
    Contents: A hookworm infection caused primarily by the species <i>Ancylostoma
      duodenale </i> or <i>Necator americanus</i> usually acquired through penetration
      of the skin (often asymptomatic but that can also manifest with an allergic
      reaction at the site of skin penetration) followed by the migration of larva
      through the bloodstream to the lungs (causing asymptomatic pneumonitis eosinophilia)
      and finally reaching and colonizing the small intestines where they cause blood
      extravasation leading to diarrhea abdominal pain and when untreated melena iron-deficiency
      anemia and protein malnutrition.
