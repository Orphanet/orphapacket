  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hypersensitivity reaction characterized by a generalized infiltrated
      skin rash with face edema fever enlarged lymph nodes eosinophilia lymphocytosis
      and more or less severe visceral involvement (e.g. hepatitis nephritis pneumonitis
      myocarditis ect.) and in some patients reactivation of human herpes virus 6
      Epstein-Barr virus and/or cytomegalovirus. Onset usually occurs 2-8 weeks after
      administration of the causal medication and is most frequently associated with
      anticonvulsants antibacterial sulfonamides and allopurinol but many other medications
      have also been implicated. Histology is characterized by interface dermatitis
      sometimes mixed with eczematous and an acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis-like
      pattern. Auto-immune sequelae may occur.
