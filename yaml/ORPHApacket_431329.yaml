  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 57 (SPG57) is an extremely
      rare complex type of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by onset in
      infancy of pronounced leg spasticity (leading to the inability to walk independently)
      reduced visual acuity due to optic atrophy and distal wasting of the hands and
      feet due to an axonal demyelinating sensorimotor neuropathy. SPG57 is caused
      by mutations in the <i>TFG </i> gene (3q12.2) encoding protein TFG which is
      thought to play a role in ER microtubular architecture and function.
