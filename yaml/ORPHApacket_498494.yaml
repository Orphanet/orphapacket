    Contents: A rare non-syndromic limb malformation characterized by a hand or foot
      with more than five digits that has a recognizable anterior/posterior axis of
      symmetry either with a hallux- or thumb-like structure or an interdigital space
      in the middle. The most lateral digits on each side typically resemble fifth
      fingers or toes. The malformation may be unilateral or bilateral and may occur
      in isolation or in association with other congenital anomalies.
