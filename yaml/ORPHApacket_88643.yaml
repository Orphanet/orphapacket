    Contents: Obesity-colitis-hypothyroidism-cardiac hypertrophy-developmental delay
      syndrome is characterised by precocious obesity congenital hypothyroidism neonatal
      colitis cardiac hypertrophy craniosynostosis and developmental delay. It has
      been described in two brothers one of whom died within the first month of life.
      The parents of the two children were nonconsanguineous and in good health however
      the pregnancies were complicated by a maternal HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis Elevated
      Liver enzymes and Low Platelets). The mode of inheritance has not yet been clearly
      established.
