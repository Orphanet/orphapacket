  TextSection:
    Contents: Oligodontia-cancer predisposition syndrome is a rare genetic odontologic
      disease characterized by congenital absence of six or more permanent teeth (excluding
      the third molars) in association with an increased risk for malignancies ranging
      from gastrointestinal polyposis to early-onset colorectal cancer and/or breast
      cancer. Ectodermal dysplasia (manifesting with sparse hair and/or eyebrows)
      may also be associated.
