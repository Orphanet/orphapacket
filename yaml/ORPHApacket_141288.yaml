  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neck malformation characterized by a congenital vertical atrophic
      and usually erythematous skin defect of variable length lacking adnexal elements
      and located along the midline of the anterior neck. It typically presents with
      a superior skin tag a midline subcutaneous fibrous cord which is often longer
      than the overlying skin defect and an inferior blind sinus from which mucus
      can be expressed. The length of the defect increases with patients' age. Likewise
      the fibrous cord becomes more prominent with age potentially leading to restriction
      of neck extension if the malformation is left untreated. Other possible complications
      include microgenia exostosis torticollis or infection.
