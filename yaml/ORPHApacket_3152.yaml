  TextSection:
    Contents: Sclerosteosis is a very rare serious sclerosing hyperostosis syndrome
      characterized clinically by variable syndactyly and progressive skeletal overgrowth
      (particularly of the skull) resulting in distinctive facial features (mandibular
      overgrowth frontal bossing midfacial hypoplasia) cranial nerve entrapment causing
      facial palsy and deafness and potentially lethal elevation of intracranial pressure.
