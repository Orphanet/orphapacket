    Contents: SHOX-related short stature is a primary bone dysplasia characterized
      by a height that is 2 standard deviations below the corresponding mean height
      for a given age sex and population group in the absence of obvious skeletal
      abnormalities and other diseases and with normal developmental milestones. Patients
      present normal bone age with normal limbs shortening of the extremities (significantly
      lower extremities-trunk and sitting height-to-height ratios) normal hGH values
      normal karyotype and Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis-like radiological signs (e.g.
      triangularization of distal radial epiphyses pyramidalization of distal carpal
      row and lucency of the distal radius on the ulnar side). Mesomelic disproportions
      and Madelung deformity are not apparent at a young age but may develop later
      in life or never.
