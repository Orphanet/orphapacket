  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by incomplete
      median clefts of both the lower lip (limited to the vermilion with no muscle
      involvement) and upper lip (with muscle involvement) double labial frenulum
      and fusion of the upper gingival and upper labial mucosa (resulting in a shallow
      upper vestibular fold) in addition to poor dental alignment and increased interdental
      distance between the lower and upper median incisors.
