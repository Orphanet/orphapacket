  TextSection:
    Contents: Bartter syndrome is a group of rare renal tubular disease characterized
      by impaired salt reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop and
      clinically by the association of hypokalemic alkalosis hypercalciuria/nephrocalcinosis
      increased levels of plasma renin and aldosterone low blood pressure and vascular
      resistance to angiotensin II.
