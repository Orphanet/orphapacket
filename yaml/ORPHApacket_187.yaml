  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of urea
      cycle metabolism and ammonia detoxification characterized by elevated concentrations
      of serum citrulline and ammonia. The disease presents with a large range of
      manifestations including neonatal hyperammonemic encephalopathy with lethargy
      seizures and coma; hepatic dysfunction in all age groups; episodes of hyperammonemia
      and neuropsychiatric symptoms in children or adults or can be asymptomatic in
      some cases (detected in newborn screening programs). Citrullinemia is divided
      into two main groups that are encoded by different genes: citrullinemia type
      I (comprised of acute neonatal citrullinemia type I and adult-onset citrullinemia
      type I) and citrin deficiency (comprised of adult-onset citrullinemia type II
      and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis due to citrin deficiency).'
