  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Citrullinemia is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder of urea
      cycle metabolism and ammonia detoxification (see this term) characterized by
      elevated concentrations of serum citrulline and ammonia. The disease presents
      with a large range of manifestations including neonatal hyperammonemic encephalopathy
      with lethargy seizures and coma; hepatic dysfunction in all age groups; episodes
      of hyperammonemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms in children or adults or can
      be asymptomatic in some cases (detected in newborn screening programs). Citrullinemia
      is divided into two main groups that are encoded by different genes: citrullinemia
      type I (comprised of acute neonatal citrullinemia type I and adult-onset citrullinemia
      type I) and citrin deficiency (comprised of adult-onset citrullinemia type II
      and neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis due to citrin deficiency) (see these terms).'
