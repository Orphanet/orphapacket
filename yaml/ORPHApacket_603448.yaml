    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by central nervous system abnormalities (particularly cerebellar hypoplasia)
      congenital microcephaly intellectual disability severe neurodevelopmental delay
      growth impairment,dystonia eye abnormalities (particularly cataract whereas
      retinal dystrophy and Leber congenital amaurosis are also reported) and congenital
