  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
      disorder characterized by infantile to childhood-onset of slowly progressive
      principally proximal shoulder and/or pelvic-girdle muscular weakness that typically
      presents with positive Gowers' sign and is associated with elevated creatine
      kinase levels hyporeflexia joint and achilles tendon contractures and muscle
      hypertrophy usually of the thighs calves and/or tongue. Other highly variable
      features include cerebellar cardiac and ocular abnormalities.
