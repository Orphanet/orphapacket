  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive disorder of the lysine catabolism characterized
      by elevated levels of lysine in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood with variable
      degrees of saccharopinuria. Some patients present with neurological symptoms
      such as seizures spastic diplegia mild psychomotor delay intellectual deficit
      and behavioral difficulties. However current findings suggest no causal association
      between isolated hyperlysinemia and neurological symptoms.
