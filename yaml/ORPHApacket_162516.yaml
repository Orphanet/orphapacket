    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by narrowing
      of the pyriform aperture (i. e. < 8 to 10 mm in a full-term infant) due to an
      overgrowth of the nasal process of the maxilla resulting in potentially lethal
      nasal airway obstruction in the newborn. Depending on the degree of obstruction
      clinical signs and symptoms include inspiratory stridor respiratory distress
      cyanosis sternal retraction ribcage asymmetry and feeding difficulties.
