  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-syndromic central nervous system malformation characterized
      by complete or near-complete absence of the cerebellum with a normal sized posterior
      fossa possibly accompanied by hypoplasia of the brainstem. The clinical picture
      is highly variable but typically includes ataxia dysarthria tremor dysmetria
      dysdiadochokinesia and oculomotor abnormalities in addition to impaired mental
      motor and language development and intellectual disability.
