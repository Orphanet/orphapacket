  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by hypoglossia micrognathia and variable limb abnormalities. Limb defects can
      involve any limb (usually all four) and the severity may vary from the absence
      of distal phalanges to total absence of digits or limbs. Synbrachydactyly may
      also be present. Patients have problems with speech swallowing and mastication
      and they have additional craniofacial anomalies (including telecanthus lower
      eyelid defects broad nose microstomia variable clefting or aberrant attachments
      of tongue mandibular hypodontia cleft palate cranial nerve palsies and facial
      asymmetry). Gingival abnormalities are frequently observed. Intelligence and
      stature are generally normal.
