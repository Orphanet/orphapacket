  TextSection:
    Contents: An atypical variant of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) a rare late-onset
      neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive freezing of gait speech
      and writing early in the disease course. Later axial rigidity and facial immobility
      can occur and supranuclear downgaze paresis may emerge after a decade. Neuropathological
      characteristics include tau pathology and neuronal loss in specific brain areas
      especially in the globus pallidus subthalamic nucleus and substantia nigra.
      The tau pathology is less widespread compared to the other PSP sub-types.
