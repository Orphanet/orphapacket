  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by a neoplasm of lymphoblasts
      committed to the T-cell lineage involving bone marrow and blood. A value of
      >25% bone marrow blasts may be used to define leukemia (as opposed to lymphoma)
      in cases with the presence of a mass lesion in addition to bone marrow involvement.
      Patients typically present with leukocytosis and frequently with a large mediastinal
      or other tissue mass. Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are common.
