  TextSection:
    Contents: Polyglucosan body myopathy type 1 is a rare genetic glycogen storage
      disorder characterized by polyglucosan accumulation in various tissues manifesting
      with progressive proximal muscle weakness in the lower limbs and rapidly progressive
      usually dilated cardiomyopathy. Hepatic involvement and growth retardation may
      be associated. Early-onset immunodeficiency and autoinflammation presenting
      with recurrent bacterial infections have also been reported.
