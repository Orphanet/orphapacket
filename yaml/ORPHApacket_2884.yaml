      by the presence of hypopigmented and depigmented skin areas (leukoderma) on
      various parts of the body preferentially on the forehead chest abdomen upper
      arms and lower extremities that are associated with a white forelock (poliosis)
      and in some cases with hypopigmented and depigmented eyebrows and eyelashes.
