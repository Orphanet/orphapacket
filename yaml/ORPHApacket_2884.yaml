    Contents: Piebaldism is a rare congenital pigmentation skin disorder characterized
      by the presence of hypopigmented and depigmented skin areas (leukoderma) on
      various parts of the body preferentially on the forehead chest abdomen upper
      arms and lower extremities that are associated with a white forelock (poliosis)
      and in some cases with hypopigmented and depigmented eyebrows and eyelashes.
