  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare centronuclear myopathy characterized by a variable severity of
      muscle weakness which is typically asymmetric with a limb-girdle pattern. Severity
      can range from skeletal asymmetry to loss of ambulation. Other manifestations
      may include respiratory muscle weakness urinary incontinence bulbar signs (facial
      weakness limitation of extra-ocular movements ophthalmoparesis ptosis and dysarthria)
      or skeletal involvement (kyphoscoliosis scoliosis joint hyperlaxity joint contractures
      of the lower extremities foot deformities and hand and/or facial contractures).
      Many female carriers remain asymptomatic.
