  TextSection:
    Contents: Palatal anomalies-widely spaced teeth-facial dysmorphism-developmental
      delay syndrome is a rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome
      characterized by global developmental delay axial hypotonia palate abnormalities
      (including cleft palate and/or high and narrow palate) dysmorphic facial features
      (including prominent forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures
      wide nasal bridge thin lips and widely spaced teeth) and short stature. Additional
      manifestations may include digital anomalies (such as brachydactyly clinodactyly
      and hypoplastic toenails) a single palmar crease lower limb hypertonia joint
      hypermobility as well as ocular and urogenital anomalies.
