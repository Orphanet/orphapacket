  TextSection:
    Contents: Dyssegmental dysplasia Silverman-Handmaker type is a rare genetic primary
      bone dysplasia disorder and lethal form of neonatal short-limbed dwarfism characterized
      by anisospondyly severe short stature and limb shortening metaphyseal flaring
      and distinct dysmorphic features (i.e. flat facial appearance abnormal ears
      short neck narrow thorax). Additional features may include other skeletal findings
      (e.g. joint contractures bowed limbs talipes equinovarus) and urogenital and
      cardiovascular abnormalities.
