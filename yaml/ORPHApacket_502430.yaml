  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome with
      variable intellectual disability characterized by abnormal head shape/metopic
      ridging and facial dysmorphism (which may include arched eyebrows ptosis downslanting
      palpebral fissures epicanthal folds and short upturned nose). Many patients
      present variable global developmental delay and/or autism spectrum disorder.
      Additional reported features are cardiac skeletal or urogenital anomalies. Brain
      imaging may show agenesis of the corpus callosum.
