    Contents: A form of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that usually has a childhood
      onset (but can range from the first to third decade of life) of severe progressive
      proximal weakness eventually involving the distal muscles. Some patients may
      remain ambulatory but most are wheelchair dependant 20 years after onset.
