  TextSection:
    Contents: "Familial pseudohyperkalemia (FP) is an inherited mild non-hemolytic\
      \ subtype of hereditary stomatocytosis that is associated with a temperature-dependent\
      \ anomaly in red cell membrane permeability to potassium that leads to high\
      \ <i>in vitro</i> potassium levels in samples stored below 37\xB0C. FP is not\
      \ associated with additional hematological abnormalities although affected individuals\
      \ may show some mild abnormalities like macrocytosis."
