    Contents: Familial pseudohyperkalemia (FP) is an inherited mild non-hemolytic
      subtype of hereditary stomatocytosis that is associated with a temperature-dependent
      anomaly in red cell membrane permeability to potassium that leads to high <i>in
      vitro</i> potassium levels in samples stored below 37°C. FP is not associated
      with additional hematological abnormalities although affected individuals may
      show some mild abnormalities like macrocytosis.
