    Contents: A rare thoracic malformation characterized by an underdeveloped and
      abnormally high scapula due to its failure to descend to the regular position

      be associated with other abnormalities such as deformities of vertebral bodies
      fused or absent ribs or genitourinary anomalies among others.
