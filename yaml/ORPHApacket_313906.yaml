  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pancreatic disease characterized by a most commonly single unilocular
      thin-walled cystic lesion which may be located anywhere within the pancreas
      (but is more frequently found in the body and tail) and does not communicate
      with the pancreatic ductal system. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with
      signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or biliary obstruction or pancreatitis.
      The condition can be isolated or occur in association with other anomalies (such
      as von Hippel-Lindau disease or polycystic kidney disease).
