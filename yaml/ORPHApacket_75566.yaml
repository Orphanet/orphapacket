  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare restrictive cardiomyopathy characterized by hypereosinophilia
      and fibrous thickening of the endocardium with usually large thrombi against
      the ventricle walls that can lead to cardiovascular complications such as heart
      failure and thromboembolism. It manifests with symptoms like edema fatigue and
      shortness of breath. It is usually secondary to eosinophil-associated tissue
      damage and is associated with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome chronic
      eosinophilic leukemia carcinoma or lymphoma.
