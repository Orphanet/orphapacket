  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary spastic paraplegia that can present as either a pure
      or complex phenotype. The pure form is characterized by lower limb spasticity
      hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses presenting in childhood or adolescence.
      The complex form is characterized by the association with additional manifestations
      including peripheral neuropathy with upper limb muscle atrophy moderate intellectual
      disability and parkinsonism. Deafness and retinitis pigmentosa have also been
      reported.
