  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyper-IgM syndrome with susceptibility to opportunistic infections is
      a rare genetic non-severe combined immunodeficiency disorder characterized by
      normal or elevated IgM serum levels with low or absent IgG IgA and IgE serum
      concentrations which manifests with recurrent or severe bacterial infections
      and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections (in particular pneumonia
      due to <i>P. jiroveci</i> but also chronic cryptosporidial cryptococcal cytomegalovirus
      and toxoplasma infections). Hematologic disorders (neutropenia anemia thrombocytopenia)
      are frequently associated. Immunologic findings reveal decreased numbers of
      CD27+ memory B cells and lack of germinal center formation.
