  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability characterized by infantile
      onset of global developmental delay and profound intellectual disability in
      association with a heterogeneous spectrum of manifestations such as features
      of lower motor neuron disease hypotonia spasticity contractures seizures respiratory
      insufficiency and optic atrophy among others. Dysmorphic craniofacial features
      include microcephaly tall forehead bitemporal narrowing flat nasal bridge low-set
      ears and high-arched palate. Brain imaging may show cerebral and cerebellar
      atrophy delayed myelination and thin corpus callosum.
