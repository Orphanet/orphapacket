  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive complex spastic paraplegia characterized
      by mostly adult-onset progressive spasticity and weakness predominantly affecting
      the lower limbs axonal motor and sensory neuropathy and cerebellar symptoms
      like ataxia dysarthria and oculomotor abnormalities. Variable degrees of cognitive
      impairment may also be present. Subtle extrapyramidal involvement and supranuclear
      gaze palsy were reported in some cases. Features on brain imaging include cerebral
      and cerebellar atrophy and sometimes abnormalities of the corpus callosum or
      basal ganglia.
