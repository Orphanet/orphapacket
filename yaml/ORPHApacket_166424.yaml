    Contents: Thinking seizures is a rare neurologic disease characterized by seizures
      induced by specific cognitive tasks such as calculation or solving arithmetic
      problems (e.g. Sudoku puzzle) playing thinking games (e.g. Rubik's cube chess
      cards) thinking making decisions and abstract reasoning. Idiopathic generalized
      seizures are mainly involved but partial epilepsies may in rare cases be observed.
