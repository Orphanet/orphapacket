  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-syndromic developmental defect of the eye disorder
      with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity most frequently characterized by
      bilateral symmetrical non-progressive cataracts which present at birth or in
      early-childhood. Additional ocular manifestations (e.g. anterior segment dysgenesis
      colobomas nystagmus microcornea microphthalmia myopia) may be associated however
      other organs/systems are usually not affected.
