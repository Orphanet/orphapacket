    Contents: A rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by microcephaly
      short stature epilepsy cerebral hypomyelination severe global developmental
      delay and progressive spasticity. Macrocytic anemia and hyperthermia have also
      been reported in association. Brain imaging reveals delayed myelination with
