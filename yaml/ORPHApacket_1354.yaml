  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by skeletal dysplasia (including coronal clefting of the vertebral bodies and
      short limbs and variable congenital heart malformations such as atrial and ventricular
      septal defects right ventricular hypoplasia and valve defects). There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1990.
