  TextSection:
    Contents: MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma is a rare form of
      malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma (see this term) that affects B cells and grows
      at the expense of lymphoid tissue associated with mucous membranes but also
      occurs more rarely in lymph nodes.
