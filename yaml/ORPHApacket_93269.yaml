      short tibiae with ovoid configuration pre- and postaxial polydactyly brachydactyly
      hypoplasia or aplasia of nails and dysmorphic craniofacial features (such as
      prominent forehead low-set and malformed ears short and flat nose lobulated
      tongue micrognathia and cleft lip/palate). Additional reported manifestations
