    Contents: A rare intoxication due to a medical product occurring as a result of
      accidental or intentional overdosing of paracetamol (acetaminophen). Patients
      may develop gastroenteritis within hours and hepatotoxicity within 24 to 72
      hours after ingestion potentially leading to acute liver injury and liver failure.
      Possible non-hepatic sequelae include renal failure thrombocytopenia pancreatitis
      and subendocardial myocyte necrosis. Chronic paracetamol poisoning may be asymptomatic
      or include all signs and symptoms potentially occurring in acute poisoning.
