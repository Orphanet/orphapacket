  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by the association
      of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (manifesting with the triad of hypohidrosis
      anodontia/hypodontia and hypotrichosis) with primary hypothyroidism and respiratory
      tract ciliary dyskinesia. Patients frequently present urticaria pigmentosa-like
      skin pigmentation increased mast cells and melanin depositions in the dermis
      and severe recurrent chest infections. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1986.
