  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital panfollicular nevus is a rare benign skin tumor disorder
      characterized by the presence of congenital large (few centimeters) elevated
      well-circumscribed pink-tan multinodular non-ulcerative bosselated-surface skin
      lesions located on the neck scalp or hand and which enlarge with time. Histologically
      hamartomatous proliferation containing irregularly arranged malformed hair follicles
      in various stages of development surrounded by fibrous tissue and densely distributed
      within the dermis is observed.
