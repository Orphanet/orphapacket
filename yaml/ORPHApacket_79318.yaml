    Contents: 'A rare congenital disorder of N-glycosylation and is characterized
      by cerebellar dysfunction abnormal fat distribution inverted nipples strabismus
      and hypotonia. 3 forms of PMM2-CDG can be distinguished: the infantile multisystem
      type late-infantile and childhood ataxia-intellectual disability type (3-10
      yrs old) and the adult stable disability type. Infants usually develop ataxia
      psychomotor delay and extraneurological manifestations including failure to
      thrive enteropathy hepatic dysfunction coagulation abnormalities and cardiac
      and renal involvement. The phenotype is however highly variable and ranges from
      infants who die in the first year of life to mildly involved adults.'
