  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare functional neutrophil defect characterized by infantile onset
      of increased susceptibility to pyogenic infections especially of the skin ears
      lung and lymph nodes with neutrophils lacking specific granules and exhibiting
      bilobed nuclei on peripheral blood smear. Bone marrow biopsy shows hypercellularity
      paucity of neutrophil granulocytes and progressive myelodysplasia. Additional
      manifestations may include mild to moderate developmental delay mild facial
      dysmorphic features (such as dysplastic ears) and anomalies of bones teeth and
      nails.
