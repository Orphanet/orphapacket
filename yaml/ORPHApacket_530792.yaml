  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ependymal tumor characterized by the presence of a <i>RELA</i>
      fusion gene. This supratentorial grade II or III ependymoma most often occurs
      in children and young adults. Histopathological features are variable but a
      distinctive vascular pattern of branching capillaries or clear-cell change are
      common. Patients may present with focal neurological deficits seizures or features
      of raised intracranial pressure. Prognosis is worse than in other supratentorial
      ependymomas.
