  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by typically bilateral asymmetric
      yellowish punctate chorioretinal lesions of the posterior pole forming a linear
      branching pattern and progressing to atrophic scars. Subretinal neovascular
      membranes occur in many cases. Vitritis is always absent. Patients may present
      with blurred vision scotoma floaters photopsia and metamorphopsia. Choroidal
      neovascular membrane formation and subretinal fibrosis are the major causes
      of visual loss. The condition predominantly occurs in young myopic females.
