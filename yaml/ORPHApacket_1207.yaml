  TextSection:
    Contents: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA-VSD) is a rare
      cyanotic congenital heart malformation characterized by underdevelopment of
      the right ventricular outflow tract and atresia of the pulmonary valve ventricular
      septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary collateral vessels. Clinical features depend
      on the anatomic variability of the lesion and patients may be minimally symptomatic
      severely cyanotic or may develop congestive heart failure. PA-VSD may represent
      a severe form of Tetralogy of Fallot (see this term).
