    Contents: 'Vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia is an inborn error
      of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) metabolism characterized by recurrent ketoacidotic
      crises or transient vomiting dehydration hypotonia and intellectual deficit
      which does not respond to administration of vitamin B12. There are two types
      of vitamin B12-unresponsive methylmalonic acidemia: <i>mut0</i> and <i>mut-</i>
