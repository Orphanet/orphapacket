  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic vascular disease characterized by congenital dysfunction
      of smooth muscle throughout the body manifesting with cerebrovascular disease
      aortic anomalies intestinal hypoperistalsis hypotonic bladder and pulmonary
      hypertension. Congenital mid-dilated pupils non-reactive to light associated
      with a large persistent patent ductus arteriosus are characteristic hallmarks
      of the disease.
