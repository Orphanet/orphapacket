  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency infantile onset
      is the most severe form of glycogen storage disease due to acid maltase deficiency
      characterized by cardiomegaly with respiratory distress muscle weakness and
      feeding difficulties. It is often fatal.
