  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated hemihyperplasia is a rare overgrowth syndrome characterized
      by an asymmetric regional body overgrowth involving at least one limb and associated
      with an increased risk of developing embryonal tumors principally nephroblastoma
      (see this term) and hepoblastoma.
