  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated hemihyperplasia is a rare overgrowth syndrome characterized
      by an asymmetric regional body overgrowth involving at least one limb and associated
      with an increased risk of developing embryonal tumors principally nephroblastoma
      and hepoblastoma.
