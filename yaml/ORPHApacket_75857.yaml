  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 6 characterized
      by a variable clinical phenotype that includes a characteristic craniofacial
      dysmorphism (including microcephaly broad nose with prominent nasal root and
      bulbous nasal tip large ears that may be malformed and low-set characteristic
      downturned mouth and short neck) global development delay intellectual disability
      and variable non-specific congenital malformations. Muscular hypotonia seizures
      retinal anomalies and variable brain abnormalities have been reported in association.
