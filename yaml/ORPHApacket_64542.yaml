    Contents: A rare acrofacial dysostosis due to the presence of manifestations not
      usually seen in Nager syndrome (NS) such as microcephaly blepharophimosis microtia
      a peculiar beakednose cleft lip and palate symmetrical involvement of the thumbs
      and great toes and developmental delay. It has since been suggested that these
      features can also be a part of the NS phenotype.
