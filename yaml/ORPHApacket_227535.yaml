  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic malignant breast tumor characterized by early onset breast
      cancer in association with a germline mutation. Tumors arising in carriers of
      <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> mutations differ morphologically and genetically
      from each other as well as from sporadic breast cancers. Most <i>BRCA1</i>-associated
      tumors are invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of no special type typically of higher
      grade than sporadic tumors and more often negative for hormone receptors. In
      addition more cases with features of typical or atypical medullary carcinoma
      are seen in these patients. Likewise <i>BRCA2</i>-associated tumors tend to
      be of higher grade than sporadic ones although their phenotype is similar. They
      show a low frequency of HER-2 expression.
