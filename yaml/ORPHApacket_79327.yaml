  TextSection:
    Contents: A severe form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation characterized
      by severe developmental and psychomotor delay muscular hypotonia intractable
      early-onset seizures and microcephaly. Additional features include altered blood
      coagulation with a high probability of hemorrhages or thromboses nephrotic syndrome
      ascites hepatomegaly cardiomyopathy ocular manifestations (strabismus nystagmus)
      and immunodeficiency. The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations in
      the gene <i>ALG1</i> (16p13.3).
