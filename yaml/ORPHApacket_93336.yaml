  TextSection:
    Contents: Polydactyly of a triphalangeal thumb or PPD2 is a form of preaxial polydactyly
      of fingers a limb malformation syndrome that is characterized by the presence
      of a usually opposable triphalangeal thumb with or without additional duplication
      of one or more skeletal components of the thumb. The thumb appearance can differ
      widely in shape (wedge to rectangular) or it can be deviated in the radio-ulnar
      plane (clinodactyly). PPD2 is also associated with systemic syndromes including
      Holt-Oram syndrome and Fanconi anemia.
