  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by
      a spectrum of clinical hematological and morphological features ranging from
      predominantly myelodysplastic to mainly myeloproliferative in nature with blood
      monocytosis (> 1G/L constituting > 10% of circulating leukocytes). Is it often
      associated with blood cytopenia and/or ''proliferative features'' (increased
      leukocyte counts splenomegaly) with marrow dysplasia and risk of progression
      to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
