  TextSection:
    Contents: 15q11.2 microdeletion syndrome is a rare partial autosomal monosomy
      with a variable phenotypic expression and reduced penetrance associated with
      an increased susceptibility to neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders
      including delayed psychomotor development speech delay autism spectrum disorder
      attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder obsessive-compulsive disorder epilepsy
      or seizures. It may also include mild non-specific dysmorphic features (such
      as dysplastic ears broad forehead hypertelorism) cleft palate neurological and
      neuroimaging abnormalities (such as ataxia and muscular hypotonia).
