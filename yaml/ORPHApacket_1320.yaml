  TextSection:
    Contents: Idiopathic camptocormia is a postural disease characterized by an anterior
      flexion of the torso (during walking or standing) that resolves in the supine
      position and that is caused by weakness of the lumbar paraspinal muscles (spinal
      extensors) due to massive fatty infiltrations of posterior spinal muscles without
      an identifiable etiology.
