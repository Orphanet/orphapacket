  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chronic photodermatosis disease characterized by intensely pruritic
      polymorphic erythematous excoriated and/or lichenified papules macules plaques
      and nodules occurring on sun-exposed areas of the skin (particularly face nose
      lips and ears) frequently associating cheilitis (especially of the lower lip)
      and conjuctivitis which are present year-round or only in the spring/summer
      (depending on geographic location) observed mainly in Native Americans and Mestizos.
      Cheilitis may be the sole clinical presentation. Histologically the presence
      of lymphoid follicles in mucosa is pathognomonic.
