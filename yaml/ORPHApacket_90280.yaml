  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus disease characterized by
      red or violaceous initially pruritic (evolving to painful) papules and plaques
      located on acral areas (especially dorsal aspects of fingers and toes while
      the nose and ear involvement is uncommon) exacerbated by cold and damp conditions
      with fissuring and ulceration occasionally observed. Coexistence of discoid
      lupus erythematosus lesions elsewhere on the body and occasional progression
      to systemic lupus erythematosus may be associated. Histological examination
      and direct immunofluorescence studies reveal nonspecific inflammatory lupus
      erythematosus changes while results of cryoglobulin and cold agglutinin studies
      are negative.
