  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (pseudo-PHP) is a disease characterized
      by a constellation of clinical features collectively termed Albright hereditary
      osteodystrophy (AHO; see this term) but no evidence of resistance to parathyroid
      hormone (PTH) which is seen in other forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP;
      see this term).
