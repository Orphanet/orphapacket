  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (pseudo-PHP) is a disease characterized
      by a constellation of clinical features collectively termed Albright hereditary
      osteodystrophy (AHO) but no evidence of resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      which is seen in other forms of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP).
