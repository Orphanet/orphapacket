  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hyperalphalipoproteinemia characterized by elevated plasma cholesterol
      and triglyceride (TG) levels with a marked TG enrichment of low- and high-density
      lipoproteins (HDL) presence of circulating beta-very low density lipoproteins
      and elevated HDL cholesterol levels in the presence of a very low or undetectable
      postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity. Premature atherosclerosis and/or
      coronary heart disease may be associated.
