  TextSection:
    Contents: Hyperlipidemia due to hepatic triacylglycerol lipase deficiency is a
      rare genetic hyperalphalipoproteinemia disorder characterized by elevated plasma
      cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels with a marked TG enrichment of low-
      and high-density lipoproteins (HDL) presence of circulating beta-very low density
      lipoproteins and elevated HDL cholesterol levels in the presence of a very low
      or undetectable postheparin plasma hepatic lipase activity. Premature atherosclerosis
      and/or coronary heart disease may be associated.
