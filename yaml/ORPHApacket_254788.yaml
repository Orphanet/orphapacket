  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorders due
      to mitochondrial DNA anomalies characterized by progressive most commonly proximal
      myopathy with variable degrees of weakness exercise-induced muscle pain and
      fatigue. Progressive external ophthalmoplegia is often observed. Additional
      features include neurological signs and symptoms (such as seizures stroke-like
      episodes or developmental delay) cardiomyopathy involvement of liver kidneys
      and gastrointestinal tract and diabetes. Lactic acidosis is frequently present
      while recurrent rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria are rare. Muscle biopsy may
      reveal the presence of ragged-red fibers and a mosaic pattern of cytochrome
      c oxidase-negative fibers.
