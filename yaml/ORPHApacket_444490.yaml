  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hyperlipidemia characterized by excessive increase in
      plasma triglyceride levels due to the accumulation of chylomicrons which manifests
      biochemically as severe hypertriglyceridemia. Clinical manifestations include
      recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis abdominal pain nausea fatigue diarrhea
      hepatosplenomegaly eruptive xanthomas lipemia retinalis and failure to thrive.
      Children may be asymptomatic with later onset of symptoms. The condition is
      not associated with severe atherosclerosis.
