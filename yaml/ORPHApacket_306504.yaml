  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital nephrotic syndrome-interstitial lung disease-epidermolysis
      bullosa syndrome is a life-threatening multiorgan disorder which develops in
      the first months of life presenting with respiratory distress and proteinuria
      in the nephrotic range and leading to severe interstitial lung disease and renal
      failure. Some patients additionally display cutaneous alterations ranging from
      blistering and skin erosions to an epidermolysis bullosa-like phenotype with
      toe nail dystrophy and sparse hair.
