  TextSection:
    Contents: A life-threatening multiorgan disorder which develops in the first months
      of life presenting with respiratory distress and proteinuria in the nephrotic
      range and leading to severe interstitial lung disease and renal failure. Some
      patients additionally display cutaneous alterations ranging from blistering
      and skin erosions to an epidermolysis bullosa-like phenotype with toe nail dystrophy
      and sparse hair.
