  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia characterized histologically
      by trophoblast proliferation absence of chorionic villi (except in cases of
      intraplacental choriocarcinoma) and tissue necrosis with bleeding. The tumor
      occurs secondary to pregnancy (ectopic or normal) miscarriage voluntary termination
      of pregnancy (VTP) or a hydatidiform mole. Indicative signs are persistent unexplained
      metrorrhagia or secondary increase stagnation or non-normalization at 6 months
      of total serum chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels after removal of a hydatidiform
      mole; persistent unexplained metrorrhagia following spontaneous abortion or
      VTP; occasionally unexplained metrorrhagia in the weeks or months following
      normal childbirth or an ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally metastases (lung liver
      brain kidneys vagina) are indicative signs in women of childbearing age.
