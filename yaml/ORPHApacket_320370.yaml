  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 43 is a rare complex hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by a childhood to adolescent onset of progressive
      lower limb spasticity associated with mild to severe gait disturbances extensor
      plantar responses muscle weakness and severe distal atrophy frequently with
      upper limb involvement. Additional features may include joint contractures distal
      sensory loss and brisk or absent deep tendon reflexes. Other signs such as depression
      memory loss optic atrophy (with vision loss) and brain iron deposition (revealed
      by brain imagery) have also been reported.
