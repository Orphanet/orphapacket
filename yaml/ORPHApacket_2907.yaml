  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary poikiloderma characterized by infantile onset of vesicopustule
      formation on hands and feet and widespread eczematoid dermatitis (both spontaneously
      resolving during childhood) as well as gradually developing diffuse poikiloderma
      with striate and reticulate atrophy (excluding the face scalp and ears) and
      development of keratotic papules on hands feet elbows and knees beginning in
      early childhood. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1981.
