  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by short stature conductive hearing loss due to bilateral auditory canal atresia
      mandibular hypoplasia and multiple skeletal abnormalities including bilateral
      humeral hypoplasia humeroscapular synostosis delayed pubis rami ossification
      central dislocation of the hips and proximal femora defects as well as bilateral
      talipes equinovarus proximally implanted thumbs and lumbar hyperlordosis. Associated
      craniofacial dysmorphism includes micro/scaphocephaly malar hypoplasia high-arched
      palate and simple dysplastic pinnae with prearicular pits/tags.
