  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare nonprogressive neurological disorder marked by intellectual deficit
      spasticity and motor retardation associated with characteristic MRI findings
      of anterior bilateral temporal lobe cysts and multilobar leukoencephalopathy.
      So far around 30 cases have been reported in the literature. Onset occurs in
      the first few months of life. Sensorineural deafness and microcephaly have also
      been reported. The etiology is unknown but an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance
      has been suggested.
