  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by an epithelial neoplasm with
      evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation typically located in the supraglottic
      larynx. The tumor can be well moderately or poorly differentiated the latter
      group being subdivided into small cell or large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas.
      There is a strong association with tobacco use. Patients present with hoarseness
      dysphagia sore throat airway obstruction hemoptysis and rarely a paraneoplastic
      syndrome due to aberrant hormone production. Poorly differentiated tumors are
      highly aggressive with high rates of regional and distant metastasis.
