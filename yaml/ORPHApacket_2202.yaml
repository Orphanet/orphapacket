  TextSection:
    Contents: Palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome is a keratinization disorder
      characterized by focal or diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma. A patchy distribution
      is observed with accentuation on the thenars hypothenars and the arches of the
      feet. The disease becomes apparent in infancy and is associated with sensorineural
      hearing loss that shows a variable age of onset. Due to genetic and clinical
      similarities it has been proposed that palmoplantar keratoderma-deafness syndrome
      knuckle pads-leukonychia-sensorineural deafness-palmoplantar hyperkeratosis
      syndrome and keratoderma hereditarium mutilans may represent variants of one
      broad disorder of syndromic deafness with heterogeneous phenotype. The disease
      is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance.
