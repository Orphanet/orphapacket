  TextSection:
    Contents: Neurocutaneous melanocytosis (NCM) is a rare congenital neurological
      disorder characterized by abnormal aggregations of nevomelanocytes within the
      central nervous system (leptomeningeal melanocytosis) associated with large
      or giant congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN). NCM can be asymptomatic or present
      as variably severe and progressive neurological impairment sometimes resulting
      in death.
