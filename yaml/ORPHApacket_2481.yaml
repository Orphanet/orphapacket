  TextSection:
    Contents: Neurocutaneous melanocytosis (NCM) is a rare congenital neurological
      disorder characterized by abnormal aggregations of nevomelanocytes within the
      central nervous system (leptomeningeal melanocytosis) associated with large
      or giant congenital melanocytic nevi (CMN; see this term). NCM can be asymptomatic
      or present as variably severe and progressive neurological impairment sometimes
      resulting in death.
