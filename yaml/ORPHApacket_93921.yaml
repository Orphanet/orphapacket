  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of neurofibromatosis characterized by the development of
      multiple schwannomas (nerve sheath tumors) without involvement of the vestibular
      nerves and often associated with chronic pain. Dysesthesia and paresthesia may
      also be present. Common localizations include the spine peripheral nerves and
      the cranium.
