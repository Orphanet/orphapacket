  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary progressive freezing gait is a rare heterogeneous progressively
      incapacitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by freezing of gait (usually
      during the first 3 years) later associating postural instability eventually
      resulting in a wheelchair-bound state. Other features may include mild bradykinesia
      rigidity postural tremor hyperreflexia speech disorder and dementia. The disease
      is unresponsive to dopaminergic treatments.
