  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant neoplastic disease characterized by clonal proliferation
      of myeloid and/or lymphoid precursors harboring rearrangements in the PDGFRA
      gene in the blood bone marrow and often other tissues as well (spleen lymph
      nodes skin etc.). It usually presents as chronic eosinophilic leukemia or less
      commonly as acute myeloid leukemia or T-lymphoblastic leukemia with eosinophilia.
      Patients usually present with eosinophilia anemia thrombocytopenia neutrophilia
      splenomegaly lymphadenopathy fever sweating and/or weight loss. Tissue infiltration
      by eosinophils can manifest with skin rash erythema cough neurological alterations
      gastrointestinal symptoms or rarely endomyocardial fibrosis and restrictive
      cardiomyopathy.
