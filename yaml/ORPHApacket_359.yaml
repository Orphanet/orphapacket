  TextSection:
    Contents: A clinically diverse group of rare eye disorders with genetic predisposition
      characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and glaucomatous changes
      of the optic nerve head leading to field defects visual loss and blindness.
      It can be sub-classified as primary (congenital glaucoma juvenile glaucoma)
      or secondary according to the presence or absence of systemic or other ocular
      anomalies (iridogoniodysgenesis Stickler syndrome Coats syndrome). The clinical
      presentation is variable and is based on age severity of glaucoma presence of
      ocular abnormalities and development of secondary IOP related abnormalities.
