  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis characterized by a rapidly
      progressive glomerulonephritis in association with the presence of circulating
      antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) mostly directed against proteinase-3
      (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). Patients usually present with urinary abnormalities
      and rapidly declining renal function often leading to dialysis within weeks
      without treatment. Cutaneous pulmonary musculoskeletal and nervous involvement
      may be observed in case of systemic disease and the correlation between ANCA
      titer and disease activity has been demonstrated.
