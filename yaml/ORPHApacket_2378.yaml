  TextSection:
    Contents: Laurin-Sandrow syndrome (LSS) is characterised by complete polysyndactyly
      of the hands mirror feet and nose anomalies (hypoplasia of the nasal alae and
      short columella) often associated with ulnar and/or fibular duplication (and
      sometimes tibial agenesis). It has been described in less than 20 cases. Some
      cases with the same clinical signs but without nasal defects have also been
      reported and may represent the same entity. The etiology of LSS is unknown.
      Different modes of inheritance have been suggested.
