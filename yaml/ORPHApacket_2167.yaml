  TextSection:
    Contents: Holzgreve syndrome is an extremely rare lethal multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic
      syndrome characterized by renal agenesis with Potter sequence cleft lip/palate
      oral synechiae cardiac defects and skeletal abnormalities including postaxial
      polydactyly. Intestinal nonfixation and intrauterine growth restriction are
      also associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1988.
