  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of cystinosis characterized by an accumulation of cystine
      in the organs and tissues particularly in the kidneys and eyes and that clinically
      manifests from infancy with renal Fanconi syndrome photophobia hypothyroidism
      impaired growth and rickets in addition to various other systemic effects. Progressive
      extra-renal manifestations include hypothyroidism hypogonadism and male infertility
      insulin-dependent diabetes hepatosplenomegaly with portal hypertension muscle
      involvement with distal muscle weakness and atrophy pharyngeal and oral dysfunction
      swallowing difficulties cerebral involvement with hypotonia speech and walking
