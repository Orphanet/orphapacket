  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare X-linked renal tubular diseases characterized by a primary proximal
      tubule dysfunction with low-molecular-weight proteinuria. Other renal features
      often include hypercalciuria nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis and progressive
      renal failure among others. There are two subtypes: Dent disease type 1 characterized
      by an isolated renal phenotype in association with <i>CLCN5</i> variants and
      Dent disease type 2 often characterized by the addition of extra renal manifestations
      in association with <i>OCRL1</i> variants.'
