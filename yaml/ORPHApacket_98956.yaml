  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare corneal dystrophy characterized by thickened redundant sheets
      of basement membrane extending into the corneal epithelium as well as intraepithelial
      lacunae filled with cellular debris together presenting as a pattern of ''maps''
      ''dots'' and ''fingerprints'' on slit-lamp examination. Patients may be asymptomatic
      or present with recurrent episodes of painful corneal erosions with variable
      visual impairment typically beginning after the age of thirty. The condition
      is bilateral and may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
