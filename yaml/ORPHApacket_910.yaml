  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genodermatosis characterized by
      extreme sensitivity to ultraviolet (UV)-induced changes in the skin and eyes
      and multiple skin cancers. It is subdivided into 8 complementation groups according
      to the affected gene: classical XP (XPA to XPG) and XP variant (XPV) (see these
