  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      an imperforate or absent mitral valve. In most cases there is a univentricular
      atrioventricular connection to a dominant right ventricle via a tricuspid valve
      and a hypoplastic left ventricle. Morphologic heterogeneity is considerable
      and hemodynamic picture and clinical manifestation depend on the type and severity
      of associated cardiovascular anomalies (such as ventricular septal defect or
      aortic atresia).
