  TextSection:
    Contents: Postaxial polydactyly-dental and vertebral anomalies syndrome is a rare
      genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by
      postaxial polydactyly and other abnormalities of the hands and feet (e.g. brachydactyly
      broad toes) hypoplasia and fusion of the vertebral bodies as well as dental
      abnormalities (fused teeth macrodontia hypodontia short roots). There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1977.
