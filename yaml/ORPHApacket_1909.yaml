  TextSection:
    Contents: Indomethacin embryofetopathy refers to the manifestations that may be
      observed in a fetus or newborn when the mother has taken indomethacin a potent
      prostaglandin inhibitor and tocolytic agent that can cross placenta during pregnancy.
      Reported adverse fetal/neonatal effects include decreased renal function resulting
      in oligohydramnios closure of the ductus arteriosus and delayed cardiovascular
      adaptation at birth. These effects are usually transient and reversible. Indomethacin
      may also be a risk factor for cerebral injury (periventricular leukomalacia)
      and necrotizing enterocolitisin preterm infants.
