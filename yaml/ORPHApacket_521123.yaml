    Contents: A rare radiation-induced disorder characterized by impairment of the
      peripheral nervous system at the level of the brachial or lumbosacral plexus
      following radiation therapy. Onset of symptoms can occur between several months
      up to decades after the last dose of radiation. Patients with radiation-induced
      brachial plexopathy typically present with mostly unilateral progressive paresthesia
      followed by weakness atrophy and pain. Symptoms in radiation-induced lumbosacral
      plexopathy include more variable combinations of numbness paresthesia pain and
      weakness and are more often bilateral.
