  TextSection:
    Contents: Pure hair and nail ectodermal dysplasia is characterised by the association
      of onychodystrophy and severe hypotrichosis which is mainly limited to the scalp
      but may also affect the eyelashes and eyebrows. Less than 20 cases have been
      reported so far. The mode of transmission is autosomal dominant.
