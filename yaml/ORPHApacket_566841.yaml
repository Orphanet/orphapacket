  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neoplastic disease characterized by the presence of ten or more
      hepatocellular adenomas in a background of normal appearing hepatic parenchyma.
      The majority of reported cases are female. There is no association with steroid
      use. The condition is considered benign although the risk of complications (such
      as malignant transformation or spontaneous rupture with intraperitoneal hemorrhage)
      is much higher than in isolated hepatic adenoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma develops
      in less than 10% of cases.
