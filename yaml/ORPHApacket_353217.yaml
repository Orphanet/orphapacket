  TextSection:
    Contents: Epileptic encephalopathy with global cerebral demyelination is a rare
      mitochondrial substrate carrier disorder characterized by severe muscular hypotonia
      seizures (with or without episodic apnea) beginning in the first year of life
      and arrested psychomotor development (affecting mainly motor skills). Severe
      spasticity with hyperreflexia has also been reported. Global cerebral hypomyelination
      is a characteristic imaging feature of this disease.
