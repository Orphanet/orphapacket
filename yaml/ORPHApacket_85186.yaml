    Contents: Endosteal sclerosis-cerebellar hypoplasia syndrome is characterized
      by congenital cerebellar hypoplasia endosteal sclerosis hypotonia ataxia mild
      to moderate developmental delay short stature hip dislocation and tooth eruption
      disturbances. It has been described in four patients. Less common manifestations
      are microcephaly strabismus nystagmus optic atrophy and dysarthria. It is appears
      to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.
