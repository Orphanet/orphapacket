  TextSection:
    Contents: Infantile spasms-broad thumbs syndrome is a rare neurologic disorder
      characterized by profound developmental delay facial dysmorphism (i.e. microcephaly
      large anterior fontanel hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures beaked
      nose micrognathia) broad thumbs and flexion and/or extension spasms. Bilateral
      cataracts hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hydrocele have also been reported.
      EEG shows hypsarrhythmic features and MRI may reveal partial agenesis of the
      corpus callosum mild brain atrophy and/or ventriculomegaly. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1990.
