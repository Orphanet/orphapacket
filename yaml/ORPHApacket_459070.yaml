  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by global developmental delay intellectual disability growth retardation hypotonia
      cerebellar symptoms such as ataxia spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia and dysmorphic
      craniofacial features (including microcephaly dolichocephaly prominent ears
      epicanthus broad nasal bridge long and flat philtrum or small mouth). Additional
      reported manifestations are epilepsy retinitis pigmentosa and urogenital abnormalities
      among others. Brain imaging may show cerebellar hypoplasia.
