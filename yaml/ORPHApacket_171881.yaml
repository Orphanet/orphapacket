  TextSection:
    Contents: Cap myopathy is a very rare congenital myopathy presenting a weakness
      of facial and respiratory muscles associated with craniofacial and thoracic
      deformities as well as weakness of limb proximal and distal muscles. Onset is
      at birth or in childhood weakness progression is slow but may lead to a severe
      and even fatal prognosis.
