  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 3-beta-hydroxysteroid
      dehydrogenase (HSD3B2) deficiency and characterized by salt-wasting and non-salt
      wasting CAH with a wide variety of symptoms including glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
      deficiencies in both sexes. Salt wasting can lead to dehydration and hypotension
      in the first few weeks of life. Affected males had undervirilization manifesting
      as a micropenis to severe perineoscrotal hypospadias. Females show normal or
      mildly virilized external genitalia (mild clitoromegaly labial fusion) due to
      dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) accumulation and conversion to androgens by the
      normal HSD3B1.
