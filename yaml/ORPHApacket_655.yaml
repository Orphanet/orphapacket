    Contents: A rare genetic renal ciliopathy characterized by reduced ability of
      the kidneys to concentrate solutes chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis occasional
      presence of cysts and progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD). The three
      clinical subtypes are characterized by the age of onset of ESRD which includes
      infantile juvenile and late onset.
