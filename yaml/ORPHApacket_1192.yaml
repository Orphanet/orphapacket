    Contents: A rare severe circulatory system disease characterized by premature
      diffuse severe atherosclerosis (including the aorta and renal coronary and cerebral
      arteries) sensorineural deafness diabetes mellitus progressive neurological
      deterioration with cerebellar symptoms and photomyoclonic seizures and progressive
      nephropathy. Partial deficiency of mitochondrial complexes III and IV in the
      kidney and fibroblasts (but not in muscle) may be associated. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1994.
