      lipodystrophy characterized by band-like horizontal asymptomatic lipoatrophic
      depressions with clinically normal overlying skin usually involving the anterolateral
      aspect of the thighs. An identifiable history of the repeated mechanical microtrauma
      due to occupational or postural habits is present.
