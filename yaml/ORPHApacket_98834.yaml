  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia characterized by evidence of granulocytic
      maturation and more than 20% of blast cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral
      blood. The maturing non-blast granulocytic cells account for greater than or
      equal to 10% and monocytic cells less than or equal to 20% of the bone marrow
      cells. Various degrees of anemia thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia are present.
      Frequent clinical manifestations include fatigue fever bleeding disorders and
      organomegaly especially hepatosplenomegaly.
