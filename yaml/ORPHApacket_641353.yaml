  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological syndrome of variable severity characterized
      by progressive spasticity affecting predominantly the lower limbs. Most patients
      manifest global developmental delay moderate to severe intellectual disability
      and white matter abnormalities in infancy complicated by variable features including
      seizures episodic respiratory failure joint contractures and ocular problems.
      Some patients have normal early development until later childhood followed by
      regression in motor cognitive and language skills over time. Some patients manifest
      only spastic paraplegia.
