    Contents: Middle aortic coarctation is a rare vascular anomaly characterized by
      the segmental narrowing of the abdominal and/or distal descending thoracic aorta
      with varying involvement of the visceral and renal arteries that commonly presents
      in children and young adults with early onset and refractory hypertension abdominal
      angina and lower-limb claudication that can lead to life-threatening complications
      associated with severe hypertension (i.e. myocardial infarction heart failure
      aortic rupture renal insufficiency and intracranial hemorrhage). It may be due
      to various congenital or acquired causes but it is most often secondary to an
      acquired inflammatory disease (i.e. Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis).
