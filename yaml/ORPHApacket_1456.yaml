  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by the segmental narrowing of
      the abdominal and/or distal descending thoracic aorta with varying involvement
      of the visceral and renal arteries that commonly presents in children and young
      adults with early onset and refractory hypertension abdominal angina and lower-limb
      claudication that can lead to life-threatening complications associated with
      severe hypertension (i.e. myocardial infarction heart failure aortic rupture
      renal insufficiency and intracranial hemorrhage). It may be due to various congenital
      or acquired causes but it is most often secondary to an acquired inflammatory
      disease (i.e. Takayasu arteritis or giant cell arteritis).
