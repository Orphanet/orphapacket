  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited human prion disease characterized by adult onset of
      slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with dementia developing relatively late
      in the disease course (classic ataxic phenotype). Patients may present with
      gait disturbances and frequent falls dysarthria dysphagia nystagmus dysmetry
      and eventually pancerebellar syndrome myoclonus spasticity severe dementia and
      mutism. The disease is invariably fatal after five years on average. Neuropathological
      hallmark is the presence of numerous multicentric prion protein plaques in the
      cerebral and cerebellar cortex.
