  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized clinically by tumor
      developing exclusively after exposure to textured breast implants and arising
      typically from the periprosthetic capsule surrounding them. Despite being a
      hematological malignancy it behaves as a solid tumor.
