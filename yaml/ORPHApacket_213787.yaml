  TextSection:
    Contents: Carcinosarcoma of the cervix uteri is a rare malignant mixed epithelial
      and mesenchymal tumor located in the cervix uteri composed of an admixture of
      carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. It usually presents with abnormal vaginal
      bleeding and a round well-defined grey to yellowish-white pedunculated polypoid
      mass protruding through the cervical canal. Association with HPV infection (especially
      serotype 16) has been frequently reported.
