  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare constitutional hemolytic anemia that is characterised by the
      association of Alport syndrome midface hypoplasia intellectual deficit and elliptocytosis.
      It has been described in two families. The syndrome is transmitted as an X-linked
      trait is caused by a contiguous gene deletion in Xq22.3 involving several genes
      including <i>COL4A5</i> <i>FACL4</i> and <i>AMMECR1</i>.
