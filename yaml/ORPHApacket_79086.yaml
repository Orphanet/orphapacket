  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lipodystrophic syndrome characterized by loss of adipose tissue
      and is a syndrome of insulin resistance that leads to increased cardiovascular
      risk. Acquired generalized lipodystrophy is related to a selective loss of subcutaneous
      adipose tissue occurring exclusively at the extremities (face legs arms palms
      and sometimes soles).
