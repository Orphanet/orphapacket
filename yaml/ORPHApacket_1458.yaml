  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by the co-occurrence of Cerebral Ocular Dental Auricular and Skeletal anomalies
      (acronym CODAS). CODAS syndrome was first reported and named in 1991. As more
      patients were described the phenotype was found to be highly variable; patients
      do not always present with all the aforementioned features.
