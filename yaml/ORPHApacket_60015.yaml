    Contents: Enlarged parietal foramina (EPF) is a developmental defect characterized
      by variable intramembranous ossification defects of the parietal bones which
      is either asymptomatic symptomatic (headaches nausea vomiting intellectual disability)
      or associated with other pathologies.
