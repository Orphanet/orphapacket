    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized radiologically by short
      stubby long bones severely angulated femurs and lesser bowing of other long
      bones (mild moderate or no bowing) short and wide iliac wings with horizontal
      acetabular roofs platyspondyly and a narrow thorax clinically manifesting with
      severe disproportionate short stature. Regression of femora angulation is observed
      with advancing age.
