  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by a rearrangement
      in MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 (so-called double-hit or triple-hit lymphoma). The
      category includes double-hit cases with features intermediate between diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma blastoid cases with a double-hit
      and cases with a DLBCL not otherwise specified morphology with a double-hit.
      It refers only to <i>de novo</i> cases not to lymphomas with a history of pre-existing
      or coexistent indolent lymphoma. Patients typically present with widespread
      disease including involvement of lymph nodes bone marrow and central nervous
      system.
