    Contents: A rare autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by adult onset of rheumatologic
      manifestations such as recurrent fever skin and pulmonary inflammation ear and
      nose chondritis vasculitis deep vein thrombosis and arthralgia. Laboratory examination
      reveals progressive hematologic abnormalities including macrocytic anemia and
      thrombocytopenia as well as elevated inflammatory markers. Bone marrow biopsy
      shows hypercellularity and signs of bone marrow dysplasia. The disease primarily
      occurs in males and is caused by somatic mutations on chromosome Xp11.
