    Contents: A rare primary lymphedema characterized by extensive multisegmental
      lymphedema associated with persistent widespread infections with various genital
      high- and low-risk human papillomaviruses resulting in multifocal anogenital
      dysplasia. Laboratory examination shows abnormalities in lymphocyte subsets
      in particular CD4+ T-cells. Epidermal nevi and capillary malformations have
      also been reported.
