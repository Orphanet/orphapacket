  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic dermis disorder characterized by slowly progressive thickening
      of the scalp which becomes raised and forms ridges and furrows with symmetrical
      distribution resembling the cerebral gyri and cannot be flattened by traction
      or pressure associated with ophthalmologic (e.g. congenital cataract) and/or
      neurological abnormalities (e.g. intellectual disability epilepsy microcephaly
      encephalopathy).
