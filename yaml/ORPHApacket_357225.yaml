  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary non-essential cutis verticis gyrata is a rare genetic dermis
      disorder characterized by slowly progressive thickening of the scalp which becomes
      raised and forms ridges and furrows with symmetrical distribution resembling
      the cerebral gyri and cannot be flattened by traction or pressure associated
      with ophthalmologic (e.g. congenital cataract) and/or neurological abnormalities
      (e.g. intellectual disability epilepsy microcephaly encephalopathy).
