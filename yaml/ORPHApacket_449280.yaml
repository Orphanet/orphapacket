  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mycosis caused by <i>Scedosporium</i> species characterized by
      disparate disease pictures including pneumonia skin and soft tissue infection
      mycetoma and disseminated infection. Central nervous system infection has also
      been reported. Infections with this ubiquitous mold can occur in a range of
      contexts like solid organ transplantation chemotherapy chronic lung disease
      but also in immunocompetent hosts and near drowning.
