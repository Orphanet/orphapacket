  TextSection:
    Contents: A partial monosomy of the long arm of chromosome 9 characterized by
      intellectual disability developmental delay with pronounced speech delay short
      stature and muscular hypotonia. Common craniofacial dysmorphic features consist
      of microcephaly prominent forehead round face arched eyebrows upslanting palpebral
      fissures strabismus short nose and thin upper lip. Other clinical findings include
      epilepsy ataxia unspecific brain MRI findings early-onset primary dystonia nail
      dysplasia and bone malformations in particular patellar abnormalities epistaxis
      and cutaneous-mucous telangiectasias.
