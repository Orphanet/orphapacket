  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by childhood onset of multiple
      endocrine manifestations in combination with central and peripheral nervous
      system abnormalities. Reported signs and symptoms include postnatal growth retardation
      moderate intellectual disability hypogonadotropic hypogonadism insulin-dependent
      diabetes mellitus central hypothyroidism demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy
      and cerebellar and pyramidal signs. Progressive hearing loss and a hypoplastic
      pituitary gland have also been described. Brain imaging shows moderate white
      matter abnormalities.
