  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cardiac disease characterized by thickening of the endocardium
      due to deposition of collagen and elastic fibers and leading to dilated cardiomyopathy-like
      phenotypes more often than to restrictive forms. It predominantly occurs in
      infants and children and may be observed as an isolated disorder or in association
      with congenital heart conditions.
