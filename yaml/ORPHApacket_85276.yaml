  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked intellectual disability Armfield type is characterised by intellectual
      deficiency short stature seizures and small hands and feet. It has been described
      in six males from three generations of one family. Three of them also had cataracts/glaucoma
      and two of them had cleft palate. The locus has been mapped to the terminal
      8 Mb of Xq28.
