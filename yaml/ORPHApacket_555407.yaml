  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by infantile onset of rapidly
      progressive neurological deterioration typically precipitated by a febrile illness.
      Patients present with hypotonia loss of previously acquired motor milestones
      and cognitive skills ataxia nystagmus tremor seizures tetraparesis and respiratory
      failure eventually resulting in a vegetative state. Imaging of the brain and
      spinal cord may show white matter abnormalities cerebral atrophy cerebellar
      edema and spinal myelopathy. Subacute development of extensive bullous skin
      lesions within weeks of onset of neurological symptoms has also been reported.
