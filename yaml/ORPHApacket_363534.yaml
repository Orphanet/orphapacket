  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome characterized by
      neonatal or early-infantile onset hepatopathy (manifesting with hepatomegaly
      cholestasis increased transaminases coagulopathy hypoalbuminemia ascites and/or
      liver failure) associated with renal tubulopathy and progressive neurodegenerative
      manifestations which include muscular atrophy hypore&#64258;exia ataxia sensory
      neuropathy epilepsy sensorineural hearing impairment psychomotor regression
      athetosis nystagmus and/or ophthalmoplegia. Patients typically present with
      recurrent vomiting severe failure to thrive feeding difficulties and fasting
