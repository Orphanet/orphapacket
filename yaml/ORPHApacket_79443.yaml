  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A (PHP1a) is a type of pseudohypoparathyroidism
      (PHP; see this term) characterized by renal resistance to parathyroid hormone
      (PTH) resulting in hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH; resistance
      to other hormones including thydroid stimulating hormone (TSH) gonadotropins
      and growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH); and a constellation of clinical
      features known as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO; see this term).
