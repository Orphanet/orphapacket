  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare glial tumor characterized by extensive infiltration of the brain
      often extending to infratentorial structures and even the spinal cord. The tumor
      corresponds to WHO grade III and is composed of elongated glial cells typically
      resembling astrocytes. Cases in which the predominant cell type is oligodendroglial
      have also been described. Some tumors develop a circumscribed neoplastic mass
      in addition to the diffuse lesion usually showing features of high-grade glioma.
      Clinical symptoms include dementia headache seizures signs of increased intracranial
      pressure and a variety of neurological deficits. Prognosis is generally poor.
