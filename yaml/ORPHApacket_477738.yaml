  TextSection:
    Contents: Pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) is a rare multiple sclerosis variant
      characterized by the onset of multiple sclerosis (i.e. one or multiple episodes
      of clinical CNS symptoms consistent with acquired CNS demyelination with radiologically
      proven dissemination of inflammatory lesions in space and time following exclusion
      of other disorders) before the age of 18 years old. Pediatric MS patients present
      a predominantly relapsing-remitting course with first attack usually consisting
      of optic neuritis transverse myelitis acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and
      monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits. A high burden of T2-hyperintense
      lesions on initial MRI primarily of the supratentorial region and/or of the
      cervical spinal cord has been reported.
