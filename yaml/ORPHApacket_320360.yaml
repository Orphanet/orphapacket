  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare complex hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized by adulthood-onset
      of slowly progressive bilateral mainly lower limb spasticity and distal weakness
      associated with lower limb pain hyperreflexia and reduced vibration sense. Axonal
      neuropathy is frequently observed on electromyography and nerve conduction examination.
