    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome without
      intellectual disability characterized by unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and
      palate and craniofacial dysmorphism (including frontal bossing hypertelorism

      manifestations are variable congenital cardiac anomalies pectus excavatum abnormalities
      of the hands and feet ocular abnormalities (myopia cataract staphyloma) and
