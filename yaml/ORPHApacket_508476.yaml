  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome without
      intellectual disability characterized by unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and
      palate and craniofacial dysmorphism (including frontal bossing hypertelorism
      broad flat nasal bridge cupped ears/thickened helices and micrognathia). Additional
      manifestations are variable congenital cardiac anomalies pectus excavatum abnormalities
      of the hands and feet ocular abnormalities (myopia cataract staphyloma) and
      conductive or sensorineural hearing loss.
