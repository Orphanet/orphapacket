  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare familial intestinal malformation characterized by failure of
      the rotation of the developing gastrointestinal tract around the superior mesenteric
      artery during embryonic development resulting in a spectrum of abnormalities
      of intestinal position and fixation. Patients most typically present in the
      neonatal period with midgut volvulus which can lead to short bowel syndrome
      or even death. Signs and symptoms include bilious vomiting feeding intolerance
      failure to thrive constipation bloody stools or intermittent apnea. The condition
      may also manifest later in life with complications like kinking or hernias and
      a broad range of intestinal symptoms. It can be an isolated finding or occur
      in association with other anomalies.
