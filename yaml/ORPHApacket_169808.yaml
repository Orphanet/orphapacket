  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A mild form of hemophilia A characterized by a small deficiency of
      factor VIII (biological activity between 5 and 40 IU/dL) leading to abnormal
      bleeding as a result of minor injuries or following surgery or tooth extraction.
      Spontaneous hemorrhages do not occur. Patients may be also labeled as having
      mild hemophilia A if they have a FVIII >40 IU/dL and a DNA change in the F8
      gene and one of the following: (i) a family member with the same DNA change
      and FVIII of <40 IU/dL and the DNA change is found in <1% of the population;
      and (ii) the international databases list the DNA change as being associated
      with hemophilia A and <40 IU/dL FVIII. The condition may affect males and female
      carriers of disease-causing mutations.'
