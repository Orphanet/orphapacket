  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of the anterior segment of the eye caused by <i>Neisseria
      gonorrhoeae</i> characterized by a severe mucopurulent conjunctivitis associated
      with lid edema often also with localized lymphadenopathy. It may be complicated
      by uveitis or keratitis which can eventually lead to corneal perforation. The
      disease most often occurs in teenagers and young adults with a male predominance
      while infections are much less common in newborns where they are typically bilateral.
