    Contents: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by intellectual
      deficit microcephaly short stature and ectodermal anomalies (including alopecia
      spontaneous formation of bullae without evident trauma hyper- or hypopigmented
      maculae acrocyanosis and dystrophic nails) in male patients. Additional reported
      features are short tapering fingers ocular anomalies (such as corneal opacities
      and cataract) and hypogenitalism. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1995.
