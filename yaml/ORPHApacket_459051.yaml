  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia characterized by progressive joint
      contractures with premature degenerative joint disease particularly in the knee
      hip and finger joints. Patients are of normal height and present with gait problems
      joint pain and enlarged joints with joint restriction and contractures. Radiological
      features include generalized platyspondyly hypoplastic ilia epiphyseal flattening
      with metaphyseal splaying of the tubular bones and broad elongated femoral necks
      with marked coxa valga. Histopathologic examination of cartilage shows PAS-positive
      cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in chondrocytes.
