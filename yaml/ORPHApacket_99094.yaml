  TextSection:
    Contents: Laubry-Pezzi syndrome is a rare non-syndromic congenital heart malformation
      characterized by the prolapse of an aortic valve cusp into a subjacent ventricular
      septal defect due to Venturi effect resulting in aortic regurgitation. Patients
      typically present with symptoms of progressive aortic valve insufficiency such
      as shortness of breath heart palpitations chest pain and exercise intolerance.
