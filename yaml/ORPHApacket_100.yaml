  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia due to a DNA repair defect
      characterized by progressive neurological impairment with cerebellar syndrome
      oculocutaneous telangiectasia defects in B and T cell-mediated immunity and
      increased susceptibility to malignancies (mainly lymphoid neoplasms). High sensitivity
      to ionizing radiation limits patient treatments.
