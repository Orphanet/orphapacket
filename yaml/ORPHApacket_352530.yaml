  TextSection:
    Contents: Intellectual disability-obesity-brain malformations-facial dysmorphism
      syndrome is a rare syndromic intellectual disability primarily characterized
      by moderate to severe intellectual disability true-to-relative microcephaly
      and brain abnormalities including a thin corpus callosum cerebellar hypoplasia
      cerebral white matter hypoplasia and multi-focal hyperintensity of cerebral
      white matter on MRI. Obesity and distinctive craniofacial dysmorphism (including
      brachycephaly round face straight eyebrows synophrys hypertelorism epicanthus
      wide and depressed nasal bridge protruding ears with uplifted lobe downslanting
      corners of the mouth) are additional features.
