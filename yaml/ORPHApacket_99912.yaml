  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare malignant germ cell tumor of ovary characterized by a solid lobulated
      mass usually with a diameter of more than 10 cm generally occurring in children
      or young women who present with abdominal pain or an abdominal mass and elevated
      serum LDH. It is bilateral in about 20% of cases although the contralateral
      tumor may not be evident on macroscopic examination. Histopathologically tumor
      cells are uniform rounded primitive germ cells with clear cytoplasm and macronucleoli
      arranged in nests or cords separated by thin fibrous septa containing lymphocytes.
      Immunohistochemistry should be positive for OCT4 or SALL4 KIT (CD117) and/or
      D2-40.
