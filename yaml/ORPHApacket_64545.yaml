  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neonatal epilepsy syndrome characterized by seizures without
      specific underlying etiology occurring during the first days of life in infants
      with an otherwise normal neurological state and no family history of neonatal
      convulsions. The most commonly partial and clonic seizures usually last for
      one to three minutes. Repeated seizures may lead to status epilepticus lasting
      up to 20 hours. Overall remission rates are high and neurological outcome is
      favorable.
