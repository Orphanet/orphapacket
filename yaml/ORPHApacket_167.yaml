    Contents: Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare severe genetic disorder generally
      characterized by partial oculocutaneous albinism (OCA see this term) severe
      immunodeficiency mild bleeding neurological dysfunction and lymphoproliferative
      disorder. A classic early-onset form and an attenuated later-onset form (Atypical
      CHS; see this term) have been described.
