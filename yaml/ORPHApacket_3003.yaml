  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lethal chondrodysplasia characterized by severe generalized osteosclerosis.
      Main clinical manifestations include large head palpebral edema flat nose low-set
      ears hexagon-like mouth a short neck (hidden by skin folds) a short and wide
      trunk a prominent abdomen and severe micromelic dwarfism with rather normal-length
      hands and feet. X-rays show marked sclerosis of the facial bones and extremities
      and poor ossification elsewhere. It has a lethal outcome either prenatally or
      during the early neonatal period. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1986.
