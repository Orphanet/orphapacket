  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease characterized by congenital muscle hypotonia
      and/or muscle atrophy that improves with age proximal joint contractures (knee
      hip elbow) and hypermobility of distal joints. Additional features include soft
      doughy skin atrophic scarring delayed motor development and myopathic findings
      in muscle biopsy. Abnormal craniofacial features have been reported in some
      patients. Molecular testing is obligatory to confirm the diagnosis.
