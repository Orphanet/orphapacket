  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by global developmental delay variable degrees of intellectual disability and
      facial dysmorphism (including high nasal bridge deep-set eyes and wide mouth)
      often associated with feeding difficulties and/or gastroesophageal reflux. Additional
      reported manifestations are seizures hypotonia autistic features and joint laxity.
      Brain imaging may show non-specific features (such as cerebral atrophy).
