  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hemorrhagic disorder caused by congenital deficiency of alpha2
      antiplasmin leading to dysregulated fibrinolysis and is characterized by a hemorrhagic
      tendency presenting from childhood with prolonged bleeding and ecchymoses following
      minor trauma and spontaneous bleeding episodes (often in unusual locations like
      diaphysis of long bones).
