    Contents: A very rare variant of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) mainly
      affecting middle-aged immunocompetent men and characterized by a consistent
      primary involvement of lymph nodes (mainly in the cervical and mediastinum lymph
      nodes) and with infrequent extra nodal involvement of the bone marrow and other
      extra-nodal sites (head and neck region liver spleen and gastrointestinal tract).
      It has an aggressive disease course and is associated with a poor prognosis.
