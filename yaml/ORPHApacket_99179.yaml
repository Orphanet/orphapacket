    Contents: Kandori fleck retina is a rare genetic retinal dystrophy disorder characterized
      by irregular sharply defined yellowish-white lesions of variable size that are
      distributed mainly in the nasal equatorial region of the retina with a tendency
      to confluence that are not associated with any vascular or optic nerve abnormalities.
      They frequently manifest as mild and stationary night blindness.
