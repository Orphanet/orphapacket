  TextSection:
    Contents: Ulbright-Hodes syndrome is characterised by renal dysplasia growth retardation
      phocomelia or mesomelia radiohumeral fusion rib abnormalities anomalies of the
      external genitalia and a potter-like facies. The syndrome has been described
      in three infants (one pair of sibs and an unrelated case) all of whom died shortly
      after birth from respiratory distress resulting from pulmonary hypoplasia and
      oligohydramnios caused by renal dysplasia. The mode of transmission appears
      to be autosomal recessive.
