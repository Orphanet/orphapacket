  TextSection:
    Contents: TMEM165-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by a psychomotor delay-dysmorphism (pectus carinatum dorsolumbar
      kyphosis and severe sinistroconvex scoliosis short distal phalanges genua vara
      pedes planovalgi syndrome) with postnatal growth deficiency and major spondylo-
      epi- and metaphyseal skeletal involvement. Additional features include facial
      dysmorphism (midface hypoplasia internal strabism of the right eye low-set ears
      moderately high arched palate small teeth) nephrotic syndrome cardiac defects
      and feeding problems. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene <i>TMEM165</i>
      (4q12).
