  TextSection:
    Contents: Drug- or toxin-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a form
      of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to the exposition to drugs.
      Drug- or toxin-induced PAH is characterized by elevated pulmonary arterial resistance
      leading to right heart failure. Drug or toxin induced PAH is progressive and
      potentially fatal.
