  TextSection:
    Contents: Drug- or toxin-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a form
      of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH see this term) secondary to the exposition
      to drugs. Drug- or toxin-induced PAH is characterized by elevated pulmonary
      arterial resistance leading to right heart failure. Drug or toxin induced PAH
      is progressive and potentially fatal.
