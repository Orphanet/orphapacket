    Contents: An extremely rare slow-growing glial neoplasm of the central nervous
      system usually arising in a superficial location in the cerebrum affecting all
      ages and both sexes and characterized by intractable seizures and headaches
      with most cases being cured by surgical incision alone and therefore having
      a good prognosis.
