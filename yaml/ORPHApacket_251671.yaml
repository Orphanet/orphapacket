  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare diffuse glial neoplasm of the central nervous system characterized
      by a slowly progressing grade 1 tumor usually arising in the cerebral cortex
      and/or brainstem with tumor cells focally organized around the blood vessels
      in a distinctive pattern. Angiocentric glioma typically affects young patients
      and is clinically characterized by refractory seizures and headaches. Nearly
      all angiocentric gliomas exhibit <i>MYB</i> alterations (most commonly <i>MYB::QKI</i>
      fusion). Most cases are cured by surgical resection alone and the prognosis
      is usually favorable.
