  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterized by the association of epiphyseal dysplasia
      short stature microcephaly and in the first reported cases congenital nystagmus.
      So far less than 10 cases have been described in the literature. Variable degrees
      of intellectual deficit have also been reported. Other occasional features include
      retinitis pigmentosa and coxa vara. Transmission appears to be autosomal recessive.
