  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by infantile onset of recurrent episodes of acute liver failure
      (resulting in chronic liver fibrosis and hepatosplenomegaly) delayed motor development
      cerebellar dysfunction presenting as gait disturbances and intention tremor
      neurogenic stuttering and motor and sensory neuropathy with muscle weakness
      especially in the lower legs and numbness. Mild intellectual disability was
      reported in some patients. MRI of the brain shows non-progressive atrophy of
      the cerebellar vermis and thinning of the optic nerve.
