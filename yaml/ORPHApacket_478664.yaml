  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy
      characterized by congenital impaired sensation of acute or inflammatory pain
      in combination with an inability to identify noxious heat or cold leading to
      numerous painless mutilating lesions and injuries. Further manifestations are
      absence of corneal reflexes resulting in corneal scarring reduced sweating and
      tearing and recurrent skin infections. Large-fiber sensory modalities such as
      light touch vibration and proprioception are normal.
