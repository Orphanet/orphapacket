  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies syndrome usually characterized
      by microcephaly ocular anomalies such as microphthalmia and apple-peel intestinal
      atresia. Facial dysmorphism is reported in some cases and may include narrow
      or sloped forehead hypertelorism microphthalmia dysplastic edematous deep-set
      eyes short palpebral fissures large or low set ears broad nasal root anteverted
      or broad nasal tip long philtrum micrognathia thin upper vermillion large mouth
      and skin tag on the cheek. Motor delay and intellectual disability have been
      reported. Heart brain craniofacial abnormalities renal hypoplasia and other
      anomalies (e.g. lower limb edema thrombocytopenia) are variably present. Rarely
      cases without intestinal atresia microcephaly or developmental delay can be
      found. Severe lethal cases have also been reported.
