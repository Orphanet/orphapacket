  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by normal early
      development followed by childhood onset optic atrophy with progressive vision
      loss and eventually blindness followed by progressive neurological decline that
      typically includes cerebellar ataxia nystagmus dorsal column dysfunction (decreased
      vibration and position sense) spastic paraplegia and finally tetraparesis.
