  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare iron storage disorder present at birth characterized by the association
      of severe hepatocellular failure with hyperbilirubinemia signs of hemorrhage
      edema ascites hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis with little to no elevation of
      transaminases. It is a distinct entity that differs from other forms of hemochromatosis
      with respect to its pathogenesis and molecular origin.
