    Contents: A rare genetic neurometabolic disorder characterized by severe progressive
      microcephaly severe to profound global development delay intellectual disability
      seizures (typically tonic and/or myoclonic and frequently intractable) hyperekplexia
      and axial hypotonia with appendicular spasticity as well as hyperreflexia dyskinetic
      quadriplegia and abnormal brain morphology (cerebral atrophy with variable additional
      features including ventriculomeglay pons and/or cerebellar hypoplasia simplified
      gyral pattern and delayed myelination). Cortical blindness feeding difficulties
      and respiratory insufficiency may also be associated.
