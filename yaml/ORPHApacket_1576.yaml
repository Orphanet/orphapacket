  TextSection:
    Contents: Infantile bilateral striatal necrosis (IBSN) comprises several syndromes
      of bilateral symmetric spongy degeneration of the caudate nucleaus putamen and
      globus pallidus characterized by developmental regression choreoathetosis and
      dystonia progressing to spastic quadriparesis. IBSN can be familial or sporadic
      (see these terms).
