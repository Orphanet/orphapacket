      vascular malformations in a metameric distribution involving the craniofacial
      region. Subtypes differ according to the distribution of lesions with cerebrofacial
      arteriovenous metameric syndrome (CAMS) 1 (medial prosencephalic group) involving
      the hypothalamus and nasal region Wyburn-Mason syndrome (lateral prosencephalic
      group) involving the occipital lobe thalamus and maxilla and CAMS 3 (lateral
      rhombencephalic group) involving the cerebellum pons and mandible.
