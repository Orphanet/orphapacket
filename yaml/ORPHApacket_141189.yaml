  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A group of rare nonhereditary complex cerebrofacial vascular malformation
      characterized by multiple ipsilateral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with
      a metameric distribution affecting various territories of the face with corresponding
      areas of the brain. The spectrum is highly variable with three types described
      according to lesion distribution: CAMS&nbsp;1 derives from the medial prosencephalon
      with concurrent involvement of hypothalamus nose forehead; CAMS&nbsp;2 arises
      from the lateral prosencephalon and involves basal ganglia optic nerve and retina
      and maxillo-facial region; CAMS&nbsp;3 derives from the rhombencephalon and
      involves cerebellum and mandible.'
