  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hyperpigmentation of the skin disease characterized by
      childhood to adulthood-onset of reticulate slightly depressed sharply demarcated
      brown macular skin lesions without hypopigmentation affecting the dorsa of the
      hands and feet and occasionally progressing to involve limbs neck forehead and/or
      trunk. Interrupted dermatoglyphics and palmoplantar pits may be additionally
      observed. Histologically hyperpigmented lesions show slightly elongated and
      thinned rete ridges mild hyperkeratosis without parakeratosis and absence of
      incontinentia pigmenti.
