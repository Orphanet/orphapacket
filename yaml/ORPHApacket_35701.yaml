  TextSection:
    Contents: 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase deficiency (HMG-CoA synthase
      deficiency) is a rare autosomal recessively inherited disorder of ketone body
      metabolism (see this term) reported in less than 20 patients to date characterized
      clinically by episodes of decompensation (often associated with gastroenteritis
      or fasting) that present with vomiting lethargy hepatomegaly non ketotic hypoglycemia
      and in rare cases coma. Patients are mostly asymptomatic between acute epidodes.
      HMG-CoA synthase deficiency requires an early diagnosis in order to avoid hypoglycemic
      crises that can lead to permanent brain damage or death.
