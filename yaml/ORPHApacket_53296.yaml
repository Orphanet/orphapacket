  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial cutaneous collagenoma is a connective tissue nevus characterized
      by multiple flesh-colored asymptomatic nodules distributed symmetrically on
      the trunk and upper arms (mainly on the upper two-thirds of the back) manifesting
      around adolescence. The skin biopsy reveals an accumulation of collagen fibers
      with reduction in the number of elastic fibers. Cardiac anomalies may be observed.
      Familial cutaneous collagenoma follows an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.
