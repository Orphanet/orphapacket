  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare osteochondrosis of the capitellum of the humerus characterized
      by involvement of the dominant upper limb and onset before the age of 10 years.
      It results from lateral compression injuries of the elbow typically occurring
      in children practising sports such as baseball and throw. It should be distinguished
      from osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum occurring later in adolescents.
