  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-acquired combined pituitary hormone deficiency-sensorineural hearing
      loss-spine abnormalities syndrome is a rare genetic non-acquired combined pituitary
      hormone deficiency disorder characterized by panhypopituitarism (with or without
      ACTH deficiency) associated with spine abnormalities including frequent rigid
      cervical spine and short neck with limited rotation and variable degrees of
      sensorineural hearing loss. The anterior pituitary gland is usually abnormal
      (typically hypoplastic) and rarely a mild developmental delay or intellectual
      disability may be associated.
