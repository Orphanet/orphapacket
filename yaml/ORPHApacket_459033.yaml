  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia characterized by onset
      of dystonia and other extrapyramidal signs ataxia oculomotor apraxia and progressive
      sensorimotor polyneuropathy in the first decade of life. Patients present distal
      muscle weakness and atrophy decreased vibratory sensation and areflexia and
      usually become wheelchair-bound by the third decade. Variable cognitive impairment
      may also be seen.
