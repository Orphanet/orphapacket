  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder of amino acid absorption and transport characterized
      by generalized hypotonia at birth neonatal/infantile failure to thrive (followed
      by hyperphagia and rapid weight gain in late childhood) cystinuria type 1 nephrolithiasis
      growth retardation due to growth hormone deficiency and minor facial dysmorphism.
      Dysmorphic features mainly include dolichocephaly and ptosis. Nephrolithiasis
      occurs at variable ages.
