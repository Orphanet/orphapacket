    Contents: A rare acquired human prion disease characterized by progressive invariably
      fatal neurodegeneration resulting from accidental transmission of CJD prions
      in the course of medical procedures or treatments (treatment with human pituitary
      growth hormone or gonadotrophin human dura mater or corneal graft exposure to
      contaminated neurosurgical instruments). Patients present rapidly progressive
      cognitive impairment as well as myoclonus visual or cerebellar problems pyramidal
      or extrapyramidal features and/or akinetic mutism. EEG examination may show
      characteristic generalized periodic sharp wave complexes. Neuropathologic analysis
      reveals spongiform change neuronal loss and gliosis and deposition of abnormal
      prion protein.
