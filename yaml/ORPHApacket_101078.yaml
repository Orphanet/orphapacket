  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 is a rare genetic axonal
      peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by an X-linked recessive inheritance
      pattern and the neonatal- to early childhood-onset of severe slowly progressive
      distal muscle weakness and atrophy (in particular of the peroneal group) as
      well as sensory impairment (with the lower extremities being more affected than
      the upper extremities) pes cavus areflexia and hammertoes. Sensorineural hearing
      loss and cognitive impairment may also be associated. Females are asymptomatic
      and do not display the phenotype.
