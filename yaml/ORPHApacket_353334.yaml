  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurovascular malformation characterized by a unilateral direct
      communication between the arterial and venous system in the retina via abnormal
      enlarged vessels but without interposed capillaries. The inferotemporal vasculature
      is most commonly affected. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with variable
      degrees of visual loss. Local vascular complications include vascular occlusions
      or retinal or vitreous hemorrhages. The anomaly may occur in isolation or as
      part of Wyburn-Mason syndrome in which intracranial (usually ipsilateral) arteriovenous
      malformations are present.
