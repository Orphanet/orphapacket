  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare astrocytoma characterized by GFAP-expressing cells with nuclear/cytoplasmic
      pleomorphism xanthomatous changes and eosinophilic granular bodies surrounded
      by a reticulin network. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) most often has cerebral
      hemispheres location with meningeal involvement mainly affects younger individuals
      and is frequently characterized by early seizure manifestation. Extent of resection
      and mitotic index are important prognostic factors. PXA commonly exhibits MAPK
      signaling pathway genes mutations (most frequently <i>BRAFV600E</i>) often combined
      with <i>CDKN2A/B</i> homozygous deletion and a specific DNA methylation profile.
      The tumor corresponds to WHO grade 2 or grade 3 mainly depending on the mitotic
      index and Ki-67 expression.
