    Contents: A rare otorhinolaryngological malformation characterized by congenital
      typically bilateral and paramedian symmetric or asymmetric fistulae in the lower
      lip which are lined by labial mucosa. The malformation is usually asymptomatic
      although it may communicate with accessory salivary glands and then result in
      secretion of saliva from the opening. Infections may also occur.
