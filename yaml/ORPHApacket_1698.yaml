  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 12 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype principally characterized by developmental or growth delay
      short stature craniofacial dysmorphism (e.g. turricephaly tall forehead downslanting
      palpebral fissures posteriorly rotated and low set ears narrow palate) congenital
      heart defects (e.g. atrial septal defect patent ductus arteriosus) hypotonia
      and pigmentary dysplasia. Scoliosis hearing loss facial/body asymmetry and intellectual
      disability have also been reported.
