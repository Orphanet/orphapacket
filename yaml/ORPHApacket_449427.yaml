  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare brain inflammatory disease characterized by thickening of the
      dura mater of the cranium or spine with at least two histiopatholgical features
      of IgG4-related disease: dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate storiform fibrosis
      and/or obliterative phlebitis. Patients typically have non-specific CSF findings
      and might be without systemic involvement or serum IgG4 elevation. Clinical
      manifestation are caused by mechanical compression of nerve or vascular structure
      leading to functional deficit most commonly headache cranial nerve palsies vision
      problems and motor weakness.'
