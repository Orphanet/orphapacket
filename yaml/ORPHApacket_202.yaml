  TextSection:
    Contents: "Crandall syndrome is characterized by progressive sensorineural deafness\
      \ alopecia and hypogonadism with LH and GH deficiencies. It has been described\
      \ in three brothers. It resembles Bj\xF6rnstad's syndrome (see this term) that\
      \ combines irregular pili torti and deafness. It is probably inherited as and\
      \ autosomal recessive disorder."
