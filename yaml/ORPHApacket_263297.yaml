  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive glycogen storage disease characterized by
      severe cardiomyopathy and cardiac dilatation potentially progressing to heart
      failure requiring transplantation. Cardiomyocytes show large inclusions of storage
      material consistent with polyglucosan. Clinical evidence of skeletal muscle
      involvement is usually absent.
