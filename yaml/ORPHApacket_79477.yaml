  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of Griscelli syndrome characterized by pigmentary dilution
      in skin and hair with irregular clumps of pigment in hair shafts resulting in
      silvery hair in association with increased susceptibility to recurrent infections
      and immunological abnormalities in particular impairment of T-cell and natural
      killer cytotoxic activity eventually leading to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
      Patients may present neurological manifestations related to infiltration of
      the central nervous system in the context of the hemophagocytic syndrome. The
      disease is mostly fatal in the first decade of life.
