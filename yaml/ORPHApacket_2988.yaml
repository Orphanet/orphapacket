  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterized by pterygium colli digital anomalies (abnormal
      small thumbs widened interphalangeal joints and broad terminal phalanges) and
      craniofacial abnormalities (brachycephaly epicanthic folds angulated eyebrows
      upward slanting of the palpebral fissures ptosis hypertelorism and prominent
      low-set posteriorly rotated ears). It has been described in a woman and her
      son but the manifestations were much less severe in the mother. The son also
      had intellectual deficit. The inheritance is either X-linked dominant or autosomal
      dominant.
