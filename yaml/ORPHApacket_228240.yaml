  TextSection:
    Contents: An extremely rare acquired dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized
      by localized increased skin laxity associated with delayed skin recoil typically
      ocurring on the elbows knees and/or neck. Histologically focal abundace of elastic
      tissue in the dermis with pleomorphic and fragmented elastic fibers without
