    Contents: Subaortic course of innominate vein is a rare congential anomaly of
      the great veins characterized by an anomalous course of the left brachiocephalic
      vein passing from left to right below the aortic arch and entering the superior
      vena cava below the orifice of the azygos vein. Patients are frequently asymptomatic
      and diagnosed incidentally on imaging studies. Other cardiac malformations may
      be associated.
