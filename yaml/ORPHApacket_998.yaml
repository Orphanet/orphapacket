  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder characterised by congenital nerve deafness and piebaldness
      with no ocular albinism. It has been described in one large pedigree. Transmission
      is X-linked with affected males presenting with profound sensorineural deafness
      and severe pigmentary abnormalities of the skin and carrier females presenting
      with variable hearing impairment without any pigmentary changes. The causative
      gene has been mapped to Xq26.3-q27.1.
