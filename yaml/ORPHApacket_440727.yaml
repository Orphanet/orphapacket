  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign eye tumor characterized by the presence of glial cells
      vascular tissue and sheets of pigment epithelial cells lacking the distribution
      and organization of the normal retina and retinal pigment epithelium. The lesion
      is most commonly found unilaterally as a slightly elevated mass in a peripapillary
      location but can also occur in the macula or the retinal periphery. It is sometimes
      associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2 nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome
      or branchio-oculo-facial syndrome. Patients may be asymptomatic or present with
      progressive loss of vision.
