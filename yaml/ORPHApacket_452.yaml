  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by lissencephaly agenesis of the corpus callosum and other cerebral structural
      anomalies early-onset intractable seizures and ambiguous genitalia. Consequences
      of hypothalamic dysfunction such as disturbed temperature regulation may be
      observed. Additional anomalies including dysmorphic craniofacial features have
      been reported. The disease is fatal in infancy or childhood in males while female
      carriers may be unaffected or show a milder phenotype with developmental delay
      behavioral abnormalities and seizures.
