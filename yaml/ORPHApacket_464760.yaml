  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic eye disease characterized by congenital profound excavation
      of the optic nerve head with diminished visual field in the absence of elevated
      intraocular pressure. Many patients lack a well-formed retinal artery and have
      multiple radial cilioretinal arteries instead. The condition is mostly bilateral
      may worsen progressively and is often complicated by serous macular detachment
      with profound visual loss.
