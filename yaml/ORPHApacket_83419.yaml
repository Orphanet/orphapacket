  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic proximal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by degeneration
      of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and lower brain
      stem manifesting with onset of progressive proximal muscle weakness (legs greater
      than arms) between 18 months and adulthood. Motor development is heterogeneous
      but walking is typically acquired.
