  TextSection:
    Contents: Estrogen resistance syndrome is a rare genetic endocrine disease characterized
      by estrogen-receptor insensitivity to estrogens and the presence of elevated
      estrogen and gonadotropin serum levels. Clinical manifestations include absent
      breast development and primary amenorrhea in association with multicystic ovaries
      and/or hypoplastic uterus in female patients normal or abnormal gonadal development
      in male patients and markedly delayed bone maturation persistence of open epiphyses
      reduced bone mineral density and variable tall stature in both sexes. Glucose
      intolerance hyperinsulinemia and lipid abnormalities may also be present.
