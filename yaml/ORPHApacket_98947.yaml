  TextSection:
    Contents: Coloboma of optic disc is a rare genetic developmental defect of the
      eye characterized by a unilateral or bilateral sharply demarcated bowl-shaped
      glistening white excavation on the optic disc (typically decentered inferiorly)
      which usually manifests with varying degrees of reduced visual acuity. It can
      occur isolated or may associate other ocular (e.g. retinal detachment retinoschisis-like
      separation) or systemic anomalies (e.g. renal).
