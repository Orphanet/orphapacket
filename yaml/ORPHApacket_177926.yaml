  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bleeding disorder in association with carrier mutations in the
      <i>F8</i> gene (Xq28) encoding coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) with a biological
      activity of FVIII &#8805;40 IU/dL and characterized clinically by abnormal bleeding
      as a result of minor injuries or following trauma surgery or tooth extraction.
      Spontaneous hemorrhages may occur occasionally. Heavy menstrual bleeding is
      the most frequent type of bleed in the carriers.
