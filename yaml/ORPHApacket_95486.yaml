  TextSection:
    Contents: Premature closure of the arterial duct is a rare arterial duct anomaly
      defined as a significant constriction or closure of the fetal arterial duct
      in the absence of structural heart defects with pathognomonic features of increased
      right ventricular afterload tricuspid regurgitation and consequently right atrial
      dilation and right ventricular hypertrophy. The severity of symptoms is related
      to the degree and rate of ductal constriction and ranges from mild postnatal
      respiratory distress to development of ventricular failure with fetal hydrops
      and intrauterine death or severe cardiopulmonary compromise in the postnatal
      period. It may be associated with a prenatal exposure to cyclooxygenase inhibitors
      or corticosteroids.
