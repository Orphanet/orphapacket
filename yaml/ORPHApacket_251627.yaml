    Contents: A rare glial tumor characterized by a highly cellular lesion that is
      diffusly infiltrating at the periphery and consists of evenly-spaced monomorphic
      cells with the oligodendroglial phenotype. It typically occurs in the supratentorial
      white matter. Histologically the cells are uniformly round to oval with round
