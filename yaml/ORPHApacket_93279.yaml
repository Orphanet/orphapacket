  TextSection:
    Contents: Mild spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia due to COL2A1 mutation with early-onset
      osteoarthritis is a type 2 collagen-related bone disorder characterized by precocious
      generalized osteoarthritis (with onset as early as childhood) and mild dysplastic
      spinal changes (flattening of vertebrae irregular endplates and wedge-shaped
      deformities) resulting in a mildly short trunk.
