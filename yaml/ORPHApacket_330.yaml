  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive systemic dysfunction of the hemostatic pathway
      that is due to a defect in the coagulation factor XII (FXII or Hageman factor)
      and is either asymptomatic or characterized by a prolonged activated partial
      thromboplastin time and an increased risk for thromboembolism. FXII deficiency
      is strongly associated with primary recurrent abortions.
