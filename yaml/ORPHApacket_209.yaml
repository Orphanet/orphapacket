  TextSection:
    Contents: Cutis laxa (CL) is an inherited or acquired connective tissue disorder
      characterized by wrinkled redundant and sagging inelastic skin associated with
      skeletal and developmental anomalies and in some cases with severe systemic
      involvement. Several different forms of inherited CL have been described differentiated
      on the basis of the mode of inheritance and differences in the extent of internal
      organ involvement associated anomalies and disease severity.
