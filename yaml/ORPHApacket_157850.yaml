    Contents: Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is the most
      common type of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) a rare
      neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive extrapyramidal dysfunction
      (dystonia rigidity choreoathetosis) iron accumulation on the brain and axonal
      spheroids in the central nervous system.
