    Contents: A rare genetic pituitary disease characterized by infantile-onset rapid
      and excessive acceleration of linear growth and body size due to mixed growth
      hormone (GH)- and prolactin-secreting adenomas and/or pituitary hyperplasia.
      Patients present with gigantism and may have associated acromegalic features
      (e.g. coarse facial features frontal bossing prognathism increased interdental
      space) as well as marked enlargement of hands and feet soft tissue swelling
      increased appetite and acanthosis nigricans.
