    Contents: A rare life-threatening congenital non-syndromic conotruncal heart malformation
      disease characterized by absent or severely undeveloped pulmonary valve leaflets
      (with a restrictive ring of thickened tissue at the place of the pulmonary valve
      annulus) associated with an intact ventricular septum and a patent ductus arteriosus
      manifesting with marked respiratory insufficiency. Additional features include
      dilated main pulmonary artery (with or without dilatation of pulmonary artery
      branches) to-and-fro flow at site of the dysplastic pulmonary valve and systolic
      pressure gradient across narrowed pulmonary valve. Tricuspid atresia and variable
      extra-cardiac anomalies (e.g. diaphragmatic hernia or cleft lip/palate) may
      be present.
