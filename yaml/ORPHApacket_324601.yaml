  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked cleft palate and ankyloglossia is a rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by the association of complete
      partial or submucous cleft palate and ankyloglossia. Patients may also present
      abnormal uvula (e.g. absent bifid shortened or laterally deviated) short lingual
      frenulum and dental anomalies (e.g. buccal crossbite absent and/or misshapen
      teeth). Digital abnormalities such as mild clinodactyly and/or syndactyly have
      also been reported.
