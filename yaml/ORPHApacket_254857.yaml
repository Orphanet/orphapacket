  TextSection:
    Contents: Lethal infantile mitochondrial myopathy is a rare mitochondrial oxidative
      phosphorylation disorder characterized by progressive generalized hypotonia
      progressive external ophthalmoplegia and severe lactic acidosis which results
      in early fatality (days to months after birth). Patients may present with lethargy
      and areflexia and may associate additional features such as cardiomyopathy renal
      dysfunction liver involvement and seizures.
