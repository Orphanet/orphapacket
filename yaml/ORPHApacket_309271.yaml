  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of Metachromatic leukodystrophy characterized by progressive
      psychomotor regression with an insidious onset after the age of 16 years most
      often beginning with intellectual and behavioral changes such as memory deficits
      or emotional instability. The clinical picture is dominated by gradual cognitive
      later also motor decline taking a protracted course with periods of waxing and
      waning. Decerebration and death occur within decades after disease onset.
