  TextSection:
    Contents: Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLS) the rarest subtype of liposarcoma (LS;
      see this term) is an aggressive fast growing tumor located usually in the deep
      soft tissues of the lower and upper extremities. It is characterized by a variable
      number of pleomorphic lipoblasts and in contrast to dedifferentiated liposarcoma
      it lacks any association with well-differentiated liposarcoma (see these terms).
