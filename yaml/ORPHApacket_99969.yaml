    Contents: Pleomorphic liposarcoma (PLS) the rarest subtype of liposarcoma (LS)
      is an aggressive fast growing tumor located usually in the deep soft tissues
      of the lower and upper extremities. It is characterized by a variable number
      of pleomorphic lipoblasts and in contrast to dedifferentiated liposarcoma it
      lacks any association with well-differentiated liposarcoma.
