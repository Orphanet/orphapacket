  TextSection:
    Contents: Dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) is a rare hemolytic anemia
      characterized by a decreased red cell osmotic fragility due to a defect in cation
      permeability resulting in red cell dehydration and mild to moderate compensated
      hemolysis. Pseudohyperkalemia (loss of potassium ions from red cells on storage
      at room temperature) is sometimes observed.
