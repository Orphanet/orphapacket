  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vasculitis characterized by mostly unilateral inflammation of
      the temporal artery affecting patients up to fifty years of age. Patients typically
      present with a lump in the temporal region or a prominent temporal artery and
      often have headaches. Males are more frequently affected than females and major
      systemic symptoms ocular complications and a biological inflammatory syndrome
      are usually absent although peripheral blood eosinophilia may be seen. Histopathological
      analysis shows arteritis predominantly of the intima with possible extension
      to the perivascular tissue. The presence of granuloma giant cells or fibrinoid
      necrosis is rare. Clinical relapses after one episode are uncommon.
