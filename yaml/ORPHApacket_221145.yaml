  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic dermis elastic tissue disorder characterized by generalized
      cutis laxa associated with severe usually early-onset pulmonary emphysema frequent
      and severe gastrointestinal and genitourinary involvement (i.e. bladder/intestine
      diverticula and/or tortuosity gastrointestinal fragility hydronephrosis) and
      mild cardiovascular involvement (typically limited to peripheral pulmonary artery
      stenosis only).
