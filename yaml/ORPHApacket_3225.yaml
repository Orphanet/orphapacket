    Contents: Hearing loss-familial salivary gland insensitivity to aldosterone syndrome
      is characterised by bilateral moderate-to-severe sensorineural hearing loss
      and salivary gland insensitivity to aldosterone resulting in hyponatremia. It
      has been described in two brothers. Transmission appeared to be autosomal recessive.
