  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 5A is a form of hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by either a pure phenotype of slowly progressive
      spastic paraplegia of the lower extremities with bladder dysfunction and pes
      cavus or a complex presentation with additional manifestations including cerebellar
      signs nystagmus distal or generalized muscle atrophy and cognitive impairment.
      Age of onset is highly variable ranging from early childhood to adulthood. White
      matter hyperintensity and cerebellar and spinal cord atrophy may be noted on
      brain magnetic resonance imaging in some patients.
