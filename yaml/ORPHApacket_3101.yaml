  TextSection:
    Contents: Richieri Costa-da Silva syndrome is a rare genetic myotonic syndrome
      characterized by childhood onset of progressive and severe myotonia (with generalized
      muscular hypertrophy and progressive impairment of gait) short stature skeletal
      abnormalities (including pectus carinatum short wedge-shaped thoracolumbar vertebrae
      kyphoscoliosis genu valgum irregular femoral epiphyses) and mild to moderate
      intellectual deficiency. No facial dysmorphism nor joint limitation is associated.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1984.
