  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular condition characterized by the sudden blockage of an
      artery supplying blood to the limbs by a blood clot causing acute limb ischemia.
      The clinical presentation is variable and depends on the time course of vessel
      occlusion the presence of an underlying vascular disease and the recruitment
      of collateral circulation. Symptoms can develop over a period of hours to days
      and typically include limb pain pallor absent pulse poikilothermia paresthesia
      and limb paralysis. The condition can quickly progress to infarction and loss
      of the limb.
