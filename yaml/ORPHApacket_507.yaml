  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A parasitic disease caused by different species of the genus <i>Leishmania</i>
      transmitted through the bite of hematophagous female phlebotomine sand flies.
      The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic to clinically overt disease which
      can remain localized to the skin or disseminate to the upper oral and respiratory
      mucous membranes or throughout the reticulo-endothelial system. Three main clinical
      syndromes have been described: visceral (or Kala-Azar; with fever weight loss
      hepatosplenomegaly) cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (cutaneous or
      mucocutaneous ulceration).'
