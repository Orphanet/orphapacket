  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by a benign usually
      supratentorial lesion with predominantly cortical location and multinodular
      architecture. The tumor typically becomes symptomatic in the second or third
      decade of life with drug-resistant partial seizures. Histological hallmark is
      the specific glioneuronal element columns oriented perpendicularly to the cortical
      surface formed by bundles of axons attached to oligodendroglia-like cells while
      neurons appear to float in an abundant eosinophilic matrix.
