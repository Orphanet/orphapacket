  TextSection:
    Contents: A congenital optic disc anomaly characterized by a funnel shaped excavation
      of the posterior fundus that incorporates the optic disc. Clinically the optic
      disc malformation resembles the morning glory flower. Morning glory disc anomaly
      (MGDA) is usually unilateral and often results in a decrease in best-corrected
      visual acuity (BCVA). MGDA can be isolated or associated with other ocular or
      non-ocular anomalies.
