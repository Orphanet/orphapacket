  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ciliopathy characterized by progressive hearing and visual loss
      in the first decades of life and in some cases vestibular dysfunction. Patients
      have normal hearing at birth. Onset of hearing loss is usually in late childhood
      or adolescence after development of speech. Profound deafness is mostly reported
      by middle age. Retinitis pigmentosa related visual loss also develops in late
      childhood or adolescence. Developmental motor milestones are generally normal
      but vestibular dysfunction may occur in adulthood.
