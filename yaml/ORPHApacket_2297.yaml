    Contents: Type A insulin-resistance syndrome belongs to the group of extreme insulin-resistance
      syndromes (which includes leprechaunism the lipodystrophies Rabson-Mendenhall
      syndrome and type B insulin resistance syndrome) and is characterized by the
      triad of hyperinsulinemia acanthosis nigricans (skin lesions associated with
      insulin resistance) and signs of hyperandrogenism in females without lipodystrophy
      and who are not overweight.
