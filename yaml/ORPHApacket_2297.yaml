  TextSection:
    Contents: Type A insulin-resistance syndrome belongs to the group of extreme insulin-resistance
      syndromes (which includes leprechaunism the lipodystrophies Rabson-Mendenhall
      syndrome and type B insulin resistance syndrome; see these terms) and is characterized
      by the triad of hyperinsulinemia acanthosis nigricans (skin lesions associated
      with insulin resistance) and signs of hyperandrogenism in females without lipodystrophy
      and who are not overweight.
