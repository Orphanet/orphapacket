    Contents: A rare neuroinflammatory disease characterized by the onset of ataxia
      dysarthia and cerebral white matter changes which are triggered by viral infection.
      Episodic progressive neurodegeneration (manifesting with loss of motor and verbal
      skills muscle weakness further cerebral white matter degeneration and eventually
      death) is observed in the absence of hematopathology cytokine overproduction
      fever hypertrigliceridemia hypofibrinogenemia and hyperferritinemia.
