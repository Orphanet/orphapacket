  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuroendocrine neoplasm of pancreas characterized by morphologically
      recognizable neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components each constituting
      at least 30% of the tumor volume. Based on histopathology mixed ductal- and
      mixed acinar-neuroendocrine carcinomas are distinguished. Patients usually present
      with unspecific symptoms related to tumor growth and/or metastasis although
      occurrence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome has been reported. Resectability of
      the tumor is the most important prognostic factor.
