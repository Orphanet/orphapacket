  TextSection:
    Contents: Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis is a respiratory disease due to repeated
      episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage without any underlying apparent cause
      most often in children. Anemia cough and pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs
      are found in majority of the patients.
