  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by lethal non-spherocytic non-immune
      hemolytic anemia in association with abnormalities of the external genitalia
      (such as micropenis and hypospadias). Reported dysmorphic features include flat
      occiput dimpled earlobes deep plantar creases and increased space between the
      first and second toes. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
