  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by the unilateral or bilateral
      occurrence of a tonic pupil (showing sectorial denervation of the sphincter
      pupillae so that the pupil constricts poorly to light while the response to
      near is present but abnormally prolonged) in association with the absence of
      deep tendon reflexes. In some patients patchy hypo- or anhidrosis may also be
      present (a variant known as Ross syndrome). The condition typically occurs in
      young adults with a female preponderance.
