  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated congenital adermatoglyphia is a rare genetic developmental
      defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized by the lack of epidermal
      ridges on the palms and soles resulting in the absence of fingerprints with
      no other associated manifestations. It is associated with a reduced number of
      sweat gland openings and reduced transpiration of palms and soles.
