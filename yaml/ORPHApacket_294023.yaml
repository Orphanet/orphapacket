  TextSection:
    Contents: Neonatal inflammatory skin and bowel disease is a rare life-threatening
      autoinflammatory syndrome with immune deficiency disorder characterized by early-onset
      life-long inflammation affecting the skin and bowel associated with recurrent
      infections. Patients present perioral and perianal psoriasiform erythema and
      papular eruption with pustules failure to thrive associated with chronic malabsorptive
      diarrhea intercurrent gastrointestinal infections and feeding troubles as well
      as absent short or broken hair and trichomegaly. Recurrent cutaneous and pulmonary
      infections lead to recurrent blepharitis otitis externa and bronchiolitis.
