  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of Crigler Najjar syndrome (CNS) a hereditary disorder of hepatic
      bilirubin conjugation characterized by severe neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
      due to a complete absence of hepatic UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. The disorder
      clinically manifests with neonatal isolated severe and permanent jaundice with
      a permanent risk of bilirubin encephalopathy.
