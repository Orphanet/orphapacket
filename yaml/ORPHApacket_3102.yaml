  TextSection:
    Contents: Richieri Costa-Pereira syndrome is characterized by short stature Robin
      sequence cleft mandible pre/postaxial hand anomalies (including hypoplastic
      thumbs) and clubfoot. It has been described in 14 Brazilian families and in
      one unrelated French patient. Prominent low set ears and a highly arched palate
      were also observed. Transmission is autosomal recessive.
