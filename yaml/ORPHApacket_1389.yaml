  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by congenital total cortical blindness intellectual disability postaxial polydactyly
      of the hands and feet pre- and postnatal growth delay psychomotor developmental
      retardation and mild facial dysmorphism (incl. prominent forehead short nose
      long philtrum high-arched palate and microretrognathia). Recurrent respiratory
      and intestinal infections as well as moderate hypertonia and hyperreflexia are
      also associated. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1985.
