  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic isolated constitutional thrombocytopenia disease characterized
      by decreased platelet counts not associated with platelet morphology or function
      impairment in multiple members of a family. Manifestations are variable typically
      ranging from asymptomatic to mild bleeding diathesis (e.g. easy bruising epistaxis
      petechiae). Occasionally a more severe bleeding tendency has been associated
      and a mild predisposition to infection and eczema has been reported.
