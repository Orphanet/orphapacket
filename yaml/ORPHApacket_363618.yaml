  TextSection:
    Contents: LMNA-related cardiocutaneous progeria syndrome is a rare genetic premature
      aging syndrome characterized by adulthood-onset cutaneous manifestations that
      result in a prematurely aged appearance (i.e. premature thinning and graying
      of scalp hair loss of subcutaneous fat tightening of skin) associated with prominent
      cardiovascular manifestations such as accelerated atherosclerosis calcific valve
      disease and cardiomyopathy. Patients present loss of eyebrows and eyelashes
      in childhood and have a predisposition to develop malignancies.
