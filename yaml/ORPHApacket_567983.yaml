  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hepatic disease characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis and
      deterioration of liver function in patients receiving parenteral nutrition for
      extended periods of time (signs may appear as early as within the first two
      weeks of initiation of parenteral nutrition). The condition commonly occurs
      in neonates and usually resolves with transition to enteral feeding although
      severe cases may progress to liver fibrosis cirrhosis and portal hypertension.
