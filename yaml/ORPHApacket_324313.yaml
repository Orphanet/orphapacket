  TextSection:
    Contents: 9p13 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting
      from a partial interstitial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 9 characterized
      by mild to moderate developmental delay hand tremors myoclonic jerks attention
      deficit-hyperactivity disorder and a social personality. Patients also present
      bruxism short stature and minor facial dysmorphic features (e.g. bilateral epicantic
