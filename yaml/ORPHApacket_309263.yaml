  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of Metachromatic leukodystrophy characterized by progressive
      psychomotor regression with an onset between 30 months and 16 years of age often
      beginning with behavioral abnormalities or deterioration of school performance.
      Further manifestations are ataxia gait disturbances reduced deep tendon reflexes
      spasticity seizures paralysis dementia and loss of speech vision and hearing
      eventually resulting in complete loss of motor and cognitive skills and decerebration.
      The rate of deterioration is variable with possible survival up to the third
      decade of life.
