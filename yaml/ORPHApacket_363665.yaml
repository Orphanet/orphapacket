    Contents: A rare genetic progeroid syndrome disorder characterized by a prematurely
      aged appearance (including lipoatrophy thin translucent skin sparse thin hair
      and skeletal muscle atrophy) delayed tooth eruption keloid-like lesions on pressure
      regions and skeletal abnormalities including marked acroosteolysis brachydactyly
