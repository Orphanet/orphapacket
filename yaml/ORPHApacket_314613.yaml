  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neoplastic disorder characterized by benign metastatic masses
      increasing in size and number after chemotherapy for non-seminomatous germ cell
      tumors of testis or ovary. It may present at any time after chemotherapy with
      a median occurrence within 24 months after treatment completion. Per definition
      the resected specimen exclusively contains mature teratoma components and serum
      tumor markers have normalized. The retroperitoneum is the most common site although
      almost any other localization has been reported. Increased tumor size may cause
      mechanical compression of vital organs with renal dysfunction bowel ischemia
      and biliary obstruction as major complications.
