  TextSection:
    Contents: A histological subtype of C3 glomerulopathy characterized by C3 deposition
      in renal tissue in the absence or near-absence of immunoglobulin deposits in
      a patient with the classic clinical features of glomerulonephritis and the electron
      microscopic findings of predominant subendothelial occasionally subepithelial
      (so-called ''humps'') and intramembranous deposits but without the typical electron-dense
      deposits of dense deposit disease.
