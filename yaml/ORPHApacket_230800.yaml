  TextSection:
    Contents: Infectious botulism is a form of botulism (see this term) a rare acquired
      neuromuscular junction disease characterized by descending flaccid paralysis
      caused by botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) produced <i>in vivo</i> leading to toxin-mediated
      infection. Infectious botulism includes wound botulism and intestinal toxemia
      botulism (infant botulism and adult intestinal botulism; see these terms).
