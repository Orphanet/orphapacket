  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital complex vascular malformation syndrome characterized
      by overgrowth of a limb (most commonly a leg) involving bones and soft tissue
      in association with capillary malformations usually in the form of port-wine
      stains and multiple arteriovenous fistulas with high-flow arteriovenous shunting.
      The latter can also lead to other severe complications including abnormal bleeding
      and heart failure. Lymphatic malformations may also be present.
