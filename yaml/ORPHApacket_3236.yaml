  TextSection:
    Contents: Conductive deafness-ptosis-skeletal anomalies syndrome is a rare genetic
      ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by conductive hearing loss due to
      atresia of the external auditory canal and the middle ear complicated by chronic
      infection ptosis and skeletal anomalies (internal rotation of hips dislocation
      of the radial heads and fifth finger clinodactyly). In addition a thin pinched
      nose delayed hair growth and dysplastic teeth are associated. There have been
      no further descriptions in the literature since 1978.
