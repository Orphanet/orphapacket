  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorders
      characterized by varying degrees of caudal abdomen pelvic renal anorectal urogenital
      and/or lumbosacral spine malformations with or without lower limb fusion. Phenotype
      is highly variable ranging from minor forms with isolated coccygeal agenesis
      to severe forms presenting with a single rudimentary limb. Central nervous system
      anomalies have also been reported.
