  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare organic aciduria characterized by increased urinary excretion
      of 3-methylglutaconic acid variably associated with neutropenia (sometimes causing
      recurrent severe infections and potentially resulting in leukemia) and progressive
      neurologic manifestations such as global developmental delay intellectual disability
      hypotonia movement disorder and seizures. Microcephaly cataract facial dysmorphism
      growth retardation endocrine abnormalities and cardiomyopathy have also been
      reported. Brain imaging may show cerebral or cerebellar atrophy or abnormalities
      of the basal ganglia.
