  TextSection:
    Contents: Idiopathic bilateral vestibulopathy is a rare otorhinolaryngologic disease
      characterized by dysfunction of both peripheral labyrinths or of the eighth
      cranial nerves which presents with persistent unsteadiness of gait (particularly
      in darkness during eye closure or under impaired visual conditions or when standing/walking
      on uneven soft or wobbly ground) and oscillopsia associated with head movements.
      The disease may be progressive presenting no episodes of vertigo or sequential
      presenting recurrent episodes of vertigo.
