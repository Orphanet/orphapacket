  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare chromosomal anomalies characterized by constitutional
      structural chromosomal rearrangements including translocations invertions duplications
      and deletions involving at least three breakpoints on two or more chromosomes.
      Individuals with such arrangements may display various phenotypes including
