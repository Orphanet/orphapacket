  TextSection:
    Contents: Non-distal trisomy 13q is a rare chromosomal anomaly disorder resulting
      from the partial duplication of the proximal long arm of chromosome 13 with
      a highly variable phenotype principally characterized by increased polymorphonuclear
      leucocyte projections and persistence of fetal hemoglobin as well as growth
      and developmental delay and craniofacial dysmorphism (incl. microcephaly depressed
      nasal bridge stubby nose low-set malformed ears cleft lip/palate micrognathia).
      Strabismus clinodactyly and undescended testes in males may also be associated.
