  TextSection:
    Contents: Biemond syndrome type 2 (BS2) is a rare genetic neurological and developmental
      disorder reported in a very small number of patients with a poorly defined phenotype
      which includes iris coloboma short stature obesity hypogonadism postaxial polydactyly
      and intellectual disability. Hydrocephalus and facial dysostosis were also reported.
      BS2 shares features with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1997.
