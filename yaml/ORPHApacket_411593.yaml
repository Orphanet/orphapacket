  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare endocrine disease characterized by hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia
      associated with the presence of autoantibodies to endogenous insulin without
      previous exposure to exogenous insulin. Patients usually present in adulthood
      with postprandial fasting- or exercise-induced hypoglycemia often with pronounced
      neuroglycopenic symptoms. Laboratory investigations reveal markedly elevated
      serum insulin as well as increased C-peptide and proinsulin. The condition may
      be associated with other autoimmune diseases monoclonal gammopathy and/or recent
      exposure to certain medications.
