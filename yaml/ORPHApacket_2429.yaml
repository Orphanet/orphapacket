  TextSection:
    Contents: Macrocephaly-spastic paraplegia-dysmorphism syndrome is a rare syndrome
      of multiple congenital anomalies characterized by macrocephaly (of post-natal
      onset) with large anterior fontanelle progressive complex spastic paraplegia
      dysmorphic facial features (broad and high forehead deeply set eyes short philtrum
      with thin upper lip large mouth and prominent incisors) seizures and intellectual
      deficit of varying severity. Inheritance appears to be autosomal recessive.
