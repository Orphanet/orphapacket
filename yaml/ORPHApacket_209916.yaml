  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue sarcoma characterized by a lesion in the deep soft
      tissues of the proximal extremities and limb girdles composed of malignant chondroblast-like
      cells arranged in cords clusters or networks and an abundant myxoid matrix.
      The tumor is typically encased by a pseudocapsule and divided into multiple
      nodules by fibrous septa. Patients present with a soft tissue mass which can
      be painful and may ulcerate the skin or restrict range of motion if located
      next to joints. Despite prolonged survival local recurrence and metastasis are
      frequent.
