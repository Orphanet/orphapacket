  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare group of coronary artery congenital malformation disorders characterized
      by an anomalous origin and course of the left or right coronary artery which
      originates from the contralateral aortic sinus of Valsalva and has an anomalous
      trajectory which may be: pre-pulmonary (with no hemodynamic consequences) retroaortic
      (with a course posterior to the aortic root and no hemodynamic consequences)
      interarterial (located between the aorta and the pulmonary artery and associated
      with a poorer prognosis) subpulmonary (with an intraconal or intraseptal course)
      or retrocardiac (located in the posterior atrioventricular sulcus). Clinical
      manifestations depend on the specific anomalous origin and course which is present
      with patients being frequently asymptomatic although nonspecific chest pain
      palpitations dizziness dyspnea or syncope usually following physical exertion
      may be associated. Sudden death due to compression/occlusion of the coronary
      artery and usually associated with or immediately following vigorous physical
      exercise may be occasionally observed.'
