  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare glomerular disease characterized by a pattern of glomerular
      injury on kidney biopsy with characteristic light microscopic changes: mesangial
      hypercellularity endocapillary proliferation and thickening of the glomerular
      basement membrane (GBM). On the basis of immunofluorescence (IF) the disorder
      is divided into C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) or immunoglobulin-mediated membranoproliferative
      glomerulonephritis. Through electron microscopy C3G is further divided into
      Dense deposit disease with highly electrondense deposits in the glomerular basement
      membrane and C3 glomerulonephritis with mesangial intramembranous subendothelial
      and subepithelial deposits. Secondary causes (autoimmune infectious malignancies)
      are excluded.'
