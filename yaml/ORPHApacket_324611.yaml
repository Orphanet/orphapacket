  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized
      by classical CMT2 signs and symptoms (progressive weakness and atrophy of distal
      limb muscles mild sensory deficits of position vibration and pain/temperature
      pes cavus and symmetrically absent or reduced muscle and sensory action potentials
      with relatively preserved nerve conduction velocities in neurophysiological
      studies) as well as pyramidal tract involvement (spasticity hyperreflexia).
      Spasticity and pain may be the presenting symptoms.
