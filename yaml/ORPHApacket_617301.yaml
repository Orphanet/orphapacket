    Contents: 'A rare disorder related to monochorionic twin pregnancy characterized
      by unequal placental sharing leading to growth restriction in one twin according
      to the following criteria: estimated fetal weight (EFW) of one twin below the
      3rd percentile as a solitary parameter or fulfilment of at least two out of
      four contributory parameters (EFW of one twin below the 10th percentile abdominal
      circumference of one twin below the 10th percentile EFW discordance of &#8805;
      25% umbilical artery pulsatility index of the smaller twin above the 95th percentile).
      Early severe forms are associated with a significant risk of intrauterine demise
      or neurological adverse outcome for both twins.'
