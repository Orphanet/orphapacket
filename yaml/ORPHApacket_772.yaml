  TextSection:
    Contents: Infantile Refsum disease (IRD) is the mildest variant of the peroxisome
      biogenesis disorders Zellweger syndrome spectrum (PBD- ZSS) characterized by
      hypotonia retinitis pigmentosa developmental delay sensorineural hearing loss
      and liver dysfunction. Phenotypic overlap is seen between IRD and neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy
      (NALD).
