  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      a bulging of the left ventricular wall connected to the left ventricle by a
      wide neck (with a ratio of the connection to the body of the anomaly >1). The
      dimensions of aneurysms have been described as small as 0.5 cm in diameter and
      as big as 8x9 cm in size. Most frequent locations are the left ventricular apex
      and the perivalvular area. Aneurysms can be a- or dyskinetic or show almost
      normal contractility. Patients may remain asymptomatic or present with systemic
      embolization congestive heart failure valvular regurgitation ventricular wall
      rupture ventricular tachycardia or sudden cardiac death.
