  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic autosomal dominant hereditary axonal motor and sensory
      neuropathy disorder characterized by childhood-onset palmoplantar keratoderma
      associated with motor and sensory polyneuropathy manifestating with late-onset
      predominantly distal lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy (later associating
      mild proximal weakness and upper limb involvement) moderate sensory impairment
      (hypoesthesia with stocking-glove distribution) and normal or near&#8208;normal
      nerve conduction velocities. Additional variable manifestations include impaired
      vibratory sensation reduced tendon reflexes paresthesia pain talipes equinovarus
      pes cavus and nail dystrophy.
