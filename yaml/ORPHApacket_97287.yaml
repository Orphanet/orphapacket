  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuroendocrine neoplasm characterized by origin from pulmonary
      neuroendocrine cells and ranging from low-grade typical carcinoid and intermediate-grade
      atypical carcinoid to high-grade large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small-cell
      carcinoma. Two thirds of the tumors are located in the major bronchi with a
      predilection for the right lung in particular the middle lobe. Most patients
      with central bronchial tumors present with hemoptysis cough recurrent pulmonary
      infections fever chest discomfort and unilateral wheezing while peripheral carcinoids
      are usually discovered only incidentally. Carcinoid syndrome or Cushing syndrome
      are very rare. The tumors may be part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1.
