  TextSection:
    Contents: Myofibrillar myopathy (MFM) describes a group of skeletal and cardiac
      muscle disorders defined by the disintegration of myofibrils and aggregation
      of degradation products into intracellular inclusions and is typically clinically
      characterized by slowly-progressive muscle weakness which initially involves
      the distal muscles but is highly variable and that can affect the proximal muscles
      as well as the cardiac and respiratory muscles in some patients.
