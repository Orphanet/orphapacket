  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary bone dysplasia syndrome characterized by multiple
      epiphyseal dysplasia severely delayed ossification (mainly of the epiphyses
      pubic symphysis hands and feet) abnormal modeling of the bones in hands and
      feet abnormal pelvis cartilage persistence and mild growth retardation. Calcium
      phosphate and vitamin D serum levels are typically within normal range while
      parathyroid hormone serum levels are normal to slightly elevated. Oligodontia
      has been rarely associated.
