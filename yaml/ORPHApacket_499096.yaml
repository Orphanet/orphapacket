  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inflammatory optic neuropathy characterized by isolated episodes
      (either single or recurrent) of optic neuritis not associated with other neurological
      or systemic disease. Patients typically present with subacute unilateral loss
      of vision progressing over several days to two weeks periocular pain and pain
      on eye movement (which may precede the onset of visual symptoms) light flashes
      on eye movement abnormal color vision reduced contrast sensitivity and relative
      afferent pupillary defect. The optic disc appears swollen in many patients and
      uveitis may be associated and can be present for years before the onset of optic
      neuritis.
