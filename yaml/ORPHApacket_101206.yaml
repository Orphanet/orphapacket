    Contents: Pulmonary valve agenesis-tetralogy of Fallot-absence of ductus arteriosus
      syndrome is a rare congenital heart malformation characterized by a tetralogy
      of Fallot (pulmonary stenosis overriding aorta ventricular septal defect and
      right ventricular hypertrophy) complete absence or rudimentary pulmonary valve
      that is both stenotic and regurgitant and an absence of the ductus arteriosus.
      It presents prenatally with cardiomegaly polyhydramnios fetal heart failure
      hydrops fetalis and fetal demise or postnatally with cyanosis and respiratory
      failure due to bronchomalacia secondary to bronchial compression from dilated
      pulmonary arteries. It is frequently associated with 22q11 deletion.
