  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases characterized by
      an infancy- to childhood-onset of progressive spastic paraplegia (with delayed
      motor milestones gait disturbances hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses)
      optic atrophy (which may be accompanied by nystagmus and visual loss) and progressive
      peripheral neuropathy (with sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness/atrophy
      in upper and lower extremities). Additional signs may include foot deformities
      spinal defects (scoliosis kyphosis) joint contractures exaggerated startle response
      speech disorders hyperhidrosis extrapyramidal signs and intellectual disability.
      In very rare cases a variant phenotype with less prominent or absent optic atrophy
      and/or neuropathy may be observed.
