  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic endocrine disease characterized by intrauterine growth
      restriction failure of an adolescent growth spurt with proportional adult short
      stature insulin resistance and early adulthood-onset diabetes. Minimal subluxation
      of the fifth metacarpal-phalangeal joint has been reported while metaphyseal
      dysplasia is absent. Testicular volume is low but fertility is normal. There
      is no evidence of primary adrenal insufficiency.
