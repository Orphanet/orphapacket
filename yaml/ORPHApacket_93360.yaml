  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with multiple dislocations is a rare
      genetic primary bone dysplasia disorder characterized by midface hypoplasia
      short stature generalized joint laxity multiple joint dislocations (most frequently
      of knees and hips) limb malalignment (genu valgum/varum) and progressive spinal
      deformity (e.g. kyphosis/scoliosis). Radiography reveals distinctive slender
      metacarpals and metatarsals as well as small irregular epiphyses metaphyseal
      irregularities with vertical striations constricted femoral necks and mild platyspondyly
      among others.
