  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia-short limb-abnormal calcification syndrome
      is a rare genetic primary bone dysplasia disorder characterized by disproportionate
      short stature with shortening of upper and lower limbs short and broad fingers
      with short hands narrowed chest with rib abnormalities and pectus excavatum
      abnormal chondral calcifications (incl. larynx trachea and costal cartilages)
      and facial dysmorphism (frontal bossing hypertelorism prominent eyes short flat
      nose wide nostrils high-arched palate long philtrum). Platyspondyly (esp. of
      cervical spine) and abnormal epiphyses and metaphyses are observed on radiography.
      Atlantoaxial instability causing spinal compression and recurrent respiratory
      disease are potential complications that may result lethal.
