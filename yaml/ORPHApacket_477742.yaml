  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a solitary mass-forming fibrous
      proliferation that usually occurs in the subcutaneous tissue composed of uniform
      fibroblastic/myofibroblastic cells displaying a loose growth pattern. Upper
      extremities trunk and head and neck are most frequently affected. The lesion
      typically grows rapidly and almost always measures less than five centimeters
      in diameter. Macroscopically it may appear circumscribed or infiltrative but
      is not encapsulated. Recurrence after excision is very rare and metastasis does
      not occur.
