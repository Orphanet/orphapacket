  TextSection:
    Contents: Megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is
      a rare congenital disease characterized by massive abdominal distension caused
      by a largely dilated non-obstructed urinary bladder (megacystis) microcolon
      and decreased or absent intestinal peristalsis.
