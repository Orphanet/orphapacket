    Contents: Congenital lethal myopathy Compton-North type is a rare genetic lethal
      non-dystrophic congenital myopathy disorder characterized antenatally by fetal
      akinesia intrauterine growth restriction and polyhydramnios and following birth
      by severe neonatal hypotonia severe generalized skeletal bulbar and respiratory
      muscle weakness multiple flexion contractures and normal creatine kinase serum
      levels. Ultrastructurally loss of integrin alpha7 beta2-syntrophin and alpha-dystrobrevin
      from the muscle sarcolemma and disruption of sarcomeres with disorganization
      of the Z band are observed.
