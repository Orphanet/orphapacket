  TextSection:
    Contents: Ketamine-induced biliary dilatation is an acquired biliary tract disease
      caused by the abusive consumption of ketamine which results in the fusiform
      dilatation of the common bile ducts (CBD) without obstructive lesions or dilatation
      of the intrahepatic biliary ducts. Possible manifestations of the underlying
      cholangiopathy include epigastric pain and impaired liver function. Severity
      of CBD dilatation appears to correlate with the duration of ketamine consumption
      and the condition has been reported to be reversible in abstinent patients.
