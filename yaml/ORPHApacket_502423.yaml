  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial myopathy characterized by motor developmental delay
      (in infancy) growth impairment and mostly proximal muscle weakness caused by
      a muscular dystrophy. Muscle biopsy presents myopathic abnormalities and decreased
      mtDNA content. Electromyography (EMG) shows a myopathic process and serum creatine
      kinase is increased. The disease is also characterized by early onset non-progressive
      cerebellar atrophy (particularly cerebellar vermis and hemispheres) corticospinal
      tract dysfunction and global or partial cerebral atrophy on brain MRI. Additionally
      some patients presented with cognitive deficiencies skeletal abnormalities tremors
      and retinopathy.
