    Contents: A rare genetic vitreoretinal degeneration characterized by a slowly
      progressive vitreoretinopathy with onset during the second or third decade of
      life. The disease initially presents as autoimmune uveitis with reduction in
      the b-wave on electroretinography and progresses with development of photoreceptor
      degeneration vitreous hemorrhage cystoid macular edema retinal neovascularization
      intraocular fibrosis secondary glaucoma and retinal detachment leading to phthisis
