  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 17 is a rare genetic
      mitochondrial disorder due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized
      by infantile-onset of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (that occasionally
      progresses to dilated cardiomyopathy) associated with failure to thrive global
      development delay muscular hypotonia elevated serum lactate and complex I deficiency
      in skeletal muscle biopsy. Intellectual disability pericardial effusion and
      a mild cardiac phenotype have been also reported.
