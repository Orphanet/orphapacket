  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by developmental
      and motor delay/regression psychomotor and cognitive regression seizures ataxia
      and visual impairment. It may present classically with late infantile-onset
      however juvenile or adult-onset has been also described. Patients with late
      infantile onset have early language and learning impairment whereas loss of
      vision and seizures appear later. In juvenile onset patients disease may progress
      rapidly (not commonly observed); notably vision loss and inability to walk is
      usually occur within 1 year of the initiation of the symptoms. Seizures can
      be absent. In the adult onset patients first symptoms become evident around
      20 years of age.
