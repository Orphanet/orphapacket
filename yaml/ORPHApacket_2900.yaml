  TextSection:
    Contents: Leri pleonosteosis is characterized by broadening and deformity of the
      thumbs and great toes in a valgus position (a 'spade-shaped' appearance) flexion
      contracture of the interphalangeal joints generalized limitation of joint mobility
      short stature and often mongoloid facies. Additional malformations include genu
      recurvatum enlargement of the posterior neural arches of the cervical vertebrae
      and thickening of the palmar and forearm fasciae. A few multigenerational families
      have been reported so far. The disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant
      manner.
