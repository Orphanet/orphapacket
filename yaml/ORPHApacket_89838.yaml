  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited epidermolysis bullosa simplex characterized by neonatal
      onset of generalized or less frequently localized acral blistering. Milia are
      rare but atrophic scarring and dystrophic nails usually occur along with focal
      keratoderma (palms and soles). Severe generalized blistering may cause perinatal
      death or persist during the entire life. Extracutaneous involvement is common
      including anemia growth retardation oral cavity abnormalities (blisters and
      erosions and caries) and constipation.
