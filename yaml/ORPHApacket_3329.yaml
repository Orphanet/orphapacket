  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome with limb reduction defects characterized by congenital
      ectrodactylous limb malformations associated with tibial aplasia or hypoplasia.
      Clinical presentation is highly variable and ranges from bilateral aplasia of
      tibiae and split-hand/split-foot deformity (tetramonodactyly or transverse hemimelia)
      to the mildest visible manifestation hypoplastic big toes. Additional malformations
      may include distal hypoplasia or bifurcation of femora hypo- or aplasia of ulnae
      and minor anomalies such as aplasia of patellae postaxial and intermediate polydactyly
      in association with split-hand deformity and cup-shaped ears.
