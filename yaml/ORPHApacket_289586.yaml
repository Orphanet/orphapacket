  TextSection:
    Contents: Exfoliative ichthyosis is an inherited non-syndromic congenital ichthyosis
      disorder characterized by the infancy-onset of palmoplantar peeling of the skin
      (aggravated by exposure to water and by occlusion) associated with dry scaly
      skin over most of the body. Pruritus and hypohidrosis may also be associated.
      Well-demarcated areas of denuded skin appear in moist and traumatized regions
      and skin biopsies reveal reduced cell-cell adhesion in the basal and suprabasal
      layers prominent intercellular edema numerous aggregates of keratin filaments
      in basal keratinocytes attenuated cornified cell envelopes and epidermal barrier
      impairment.
