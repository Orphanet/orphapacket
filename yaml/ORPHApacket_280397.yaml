  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease is an exceedingly rare form of
      prion disease (see this term) characterized by the neuropathological features
      of Alzheimer disease including memory impairment and depression related to abnormal
      prion protein (PrP) caused by a gene mutation in <i>PRNP</i>. Patients present
      with a prolonged atypical course (absence of myoclonus or ataxia) unlike other
      forms of prion disease with severe neurofibrillary tangle pathology and high
      levels of cerebral amyloidosis.
