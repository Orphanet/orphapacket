  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial Alzheimer-like prion disease is an exceedingly rare form of
      prion disease characterized by the neuropathological features of Alzheimer disease
      including memory impairment and depression related to abnormal prion protein
      (PrP) caused by a gene mutation in <i>PRNP</i>. Patients present with a prolonged
      atypical course (absence of myoclonus or ataxia) unlike other forms of prion
      disease with severe neurofibrillary tangle pathology and high levels of cerebral
      amyloidosis.
