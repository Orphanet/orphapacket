  TextSection:
    Contents: MOGS-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by generalized hypotonia craniofacial dysmorphism (prominent occiput
      short palpebral fissures long eyelashes broad nose high arched palate  retrognathia)
      hypoplastic genitalia seizures feeding difficulties hypoventilation severe hypogammaglobulinemia
      with generalized edema and increased resistance to particular viral infections
      (particularly to enveloped viruses). The disease is caused by loss-of-function
      mutations in the gene <i> MOGS </i> (2p13.1).
