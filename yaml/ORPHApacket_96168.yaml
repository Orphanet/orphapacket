    Contents: Monosomy 13q34 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from
      the partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 principally characterized
      by global developmental delay mild intellectual disability obesity and mild
      craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly wide rectangular forehead downslanting
      palpebral fissures mild ptosis prominent nose with long nasal bridge and broad
      tip small chin). Other variable reported features include congenital heart defects
      hand and foot anomalies (e.g. polydactyly) and agenesis of the corpus callosum.
