  TextSection:
    Contents: Ulna metaphyseal dysplasia syndrome is a rare primary bone dysplasia
      characterized by dysplasia of the distal ulnar metaphyses as well as metacarpal/metatarsal
      dysplasia and metaphyseal changes resembling enchondromata. Patients usually
      present bony swelling of the wrists with or without pain (knees and ankles may
      also be affected). Other variably associated features include platyspondyly
      skeletal development delay short stature and coxa valga.
