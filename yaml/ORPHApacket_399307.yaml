    Contents: A rare osteonecrosis characterized by bone necrosis due to disrupted
      blood supply in the absence of a known cause. Affected bones include the femoral
      head talus vertebral body humerus and scaphoid among others. Patients may initially
      be asymptomatic but subsequently present with gradually developing refractory
      pain swelling and reduced range of motion. If left untreated the condition may
      progress to bone collapse with secondary degeneration fragmentation and pathological
      fracture as well as osteoarthritis.
