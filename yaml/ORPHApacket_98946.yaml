  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect of the eye characterized by a uni-
      or bilateral symmetrical or asymmetrical partial or full thickness defect of
      the superior or inferior eyelid margin ranging in size from a small notch to
      complete absence of the entire lid typically located on the medial to lateral
      third of the eyelid resulting in an unprotected cornea and thus possibly leading
      to exposure keratopathy and vision impairment. It may occur isolated be associated
      with other ocular defects or be part of a craniofacial syndrome such as Treacher-Collins
      or Goldenhar syndrome.
