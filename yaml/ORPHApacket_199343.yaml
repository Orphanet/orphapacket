  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by the association of epilepsy
      ataxia sensorineural hearing impairment and renal tubulopathy. Patients present
      in infancy with generalized seizures cerebellar dysfunction (including gait
      ataxia intention tremor and dysdiadochokinesis) and variable developmental delay
      and sensorineural hearing loss. Laboratory studies show persistent hypokalemic
      metabolic acidosis with hypomagnesemia. Additional reported neurologic features
      include brisk deep tendon reflexes ankle clonus extensor plantar responses or
      nystagmus.
