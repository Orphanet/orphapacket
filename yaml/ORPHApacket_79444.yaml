  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1c (PHP1c) is a rare type of pseudohypoparathyroidism
      (PHP; see this term) characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH)
      and other hormones which manifests with hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia and elevated
      PTH levels a constellation of clinical features collectively termed Albright's
      hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO; see this term) but normal activity of the stimulatory
      protein G (Gs alpha).
