  TextSection:
    Contents: Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1c (PHP1c) is a rare type of pseudohypoparathyroidism
      (PHP) characterized by resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH) and other hormones
      which manifests with hypocalcemia hyperphosphatemia and elevated PTH levels
      a constellation of clinical features collectively termed Albright's hereditary
      osteodystrophy (AHO) but normal activity of the stimulatory protein G (Gs alpha).
