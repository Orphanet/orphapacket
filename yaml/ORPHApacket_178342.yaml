  TextSection:
    Contents: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor is a rare neoplastic lesion of the
      submucosal stroma which can develop in any organ often occurring in the lung
      mesentery omentum and the retroperitoneal region. It is histologically heterogenous
      composed of spindle-shaped cells myofibroblasts and inflammatory cells. It is
      usually benign however local invasion recurrence malignant transformation with
      vascular invasion and metastases may occur. The presentation is nonspecific
      and depends on the organ involved. Some patients may present with paraneoplastic
      syndrome (fever malaise weight loss anemia thrombocytosis) or symptoms related
      to compression of adjacent organs such as bowel obstruction.
