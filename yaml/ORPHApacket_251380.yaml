  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemoglobinopathy characterized by generally mild clinical
      phenotype high fetal hemoglobin levels and mild microcytosis and hypochromia.
      In some cases acute sickle cell disease manifestations were reported namely
      acute chest syndrome and acute pain crisis. The genotype is characterized by
      the combination of an HbS and HbF allele; symptoms depend on the degree of HbF:HbS
      expressivity with patients with more than 35% pancellular HbF expression being
      asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients have heterocellular expression of HbF.
