  TextSection:
    Contents: FADD-related immunodeficiency is a rare genetic immunological disease
      reported in a single consanguineous Pakistani family with several affected members
      presenting with severe bacterial and viral infections recurrent hepatopathy
      (portal inflammation fibrosis) and recurrent stereotypical febrile episodes
      sometimes lasting several days with encephalopathy and difficult-to-control
      seizures. Variable cardiac malformations were also reported. Although there
      were autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)-like biological features
      clinical ALPS was not present. A homozygous missense mutation in the <i>FADD</i>
      gene (11q13.3) was found in the family and the disease is thought to follow
      an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance.
