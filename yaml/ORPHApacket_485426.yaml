    Contents: A rare parenchymal liver disease characterized by progressive fibrosis
      of the portal tracts due to arrest of maturation of the ductal plate of the
      intrahepatic bile ducts. Clinically it may manifest as a portal hypertensive
      cholangitic mixed or latent form. Onset of symptoms is mostly in adolescence
      or young adulthood. Hepatocellular function is relatively well preserved.
