  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare renal disease occurring in the setting of a systemic IgG4 related
      disease (IgG4-RD). The disorder is characterized by a fibrosing tubulointerstitial
      nephritis consisting of predominantly IgG4+ plasma cells with/without glomerulonephritis
      retroperitoneal fibrosis and hydronephrosis.
