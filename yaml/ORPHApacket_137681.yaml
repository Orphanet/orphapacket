    Contents: A rare inherited mitochondrial disorder due to a defect in mitochondrial
      protein synthesis characterized by intrauterine growth retardation metabolic
      decompensation with recurrent vomiting persistent severe lactic acidosis encephalopathy
      seizures failure to thrive severe global developmental delay poor eye contact
      severe muscular hypotonia or axial hypotonia with limb hypertonia hepatomegaly
      and/or liver dysfunction and/or liver failure leading to fatal outcome in severe
      cases. Neuroimaging abnormalities may include corpus callosum thinning leukodystrophy
      delayed myelination and basal ganglia involvement.
