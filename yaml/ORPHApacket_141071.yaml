  TextSection:
    Contents: Digestive duplication cyst of the tongue is an extremely rare otorhinolaryngological
      malformation which occurs during early embryogenesis and is characterized by
      a single and on occasion multiple cystic lesion that is most frequently located
      in the anterior portion of the tongue either deeply embedded within it or superficially
      on it. Depending mostly on size and location of the cyst patients could be asymptomatic
      or could present a wide array of symptoms such as varying degrees of respiratory
      and feeding difficulties lingual swelling and protrusion dysphagia and more
      rarely recurrent bleeding or brownish discharge from a lingual sinus.
