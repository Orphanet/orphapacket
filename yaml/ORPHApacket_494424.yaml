    Contents: A rare vascular anomaly characterized by dilation of the internal or
      the common carotid artery greater than 150% of the diameter of the normal healthy
      vessel. Lesions of the carotid bifurcation are typically fusiform degenerative
      in nature and may occur bilaterally while saccular aneurysms are usually unilateral
      and mostly located in the middle segment of the internal carotid artery. Symptomatic
      patients may present with a palpable pulsating mass local pain cerebral ischemia
      peripheral nerve dysfunction stridor or voice changes due to local compression.
