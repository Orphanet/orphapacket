    Contents: Foix-Alajouanine syndrome also called subacute ascending necrotising
      myelitis results from chronic congestion of the extrinsic pial veins of the
      spinal cord and of the intrinsic subpial network. It is characterised by progressive
      ascending deficit over a period of several months or years.
