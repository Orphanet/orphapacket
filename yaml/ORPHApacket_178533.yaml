  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary cutaneous gamma/delta-positive T-cell lymphoma is a rare usually
      aggressive subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by infiltration
      of the epidermis dermis or subcutaneous tissue by a clonal population of mature
      gamma/delta positive cytotoxic T-cells. Typically it presents with ulcerating
      plaques tumors or subcutaneous nodules on the skin of the extremities however
      frequent involvement of mucosal and extranodal sites (such as the nasal cavity
      gastrointestinal tract or lungs) is also observed. Cases associated with panniculitis
      may present with hemophagocytic syndrome (abrupt onset of fever rash cytopenia
      hepatosplenomegaly and neurological compromise). Infiltration of lymph nodes
      spleen and bone marrow is uncommon and resistance to multilineage chemotherapy
      is reported.
