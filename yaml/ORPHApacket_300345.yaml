  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multisystemic chronic autoimmune disease characterized
      by the presence of systemic lupus erythematosus symptoms in two or more members
      of a single family. Patients present a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations
      including cutaneous (malar rash photosensitivity) ocular (keratoconjunctivitis
      sicca retinopathy) gastrointestinal (oral ulceration abdominal pain) cardiac
      (atherosclerosis chest pain) pulmonary (serositis pleurisy) musculoskeletal
      (arthralgia myalgia) renal (nephritis hematuria) obstetrical (increased spontaneous
      abortions neonatal lupus) constitutional (fatigue loss of appetite) and neuropsychiatric
      (mood and cognitive disorders) involvement among others.
