      in later advanced stages. It may present with symptoms related to the anatomical
      location of the tumor (rectal mass rectal bleeding and pain tenesmus or changes
      in bowel habits) symptoms of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and increased gut
      motility) or nonspecific symptoms of advanced disease (hepatomegaly fever weight
