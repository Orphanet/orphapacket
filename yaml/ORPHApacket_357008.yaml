  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) characterized by infantile
      onset of relapsing episodes of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia
      and acute kidney injury. The episodes are often preceded by viral infections.
      Affected individuals typically present persistent hypertension hematuria and
      proteinuria (sometimes in the nephrotic range) and develop chronic kidney disease
      with age.
