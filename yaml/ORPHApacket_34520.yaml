  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital muscular dystrophy with integrin alpha-7 deficiency is a
      rare genetic congenital muscular dystrophy due to extracellular matrix protein
      anomaly characterized by early motor development delay and muscle weakness with
      mild elevation of serum creatine kinase that may be followed by progressive
      disease course with predominantly proximal muscle weakness and atrophy motor
      development regress scoliosis and respiratory insufficiency.
