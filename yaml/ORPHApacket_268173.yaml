  TextSection:
    Contents: Intermittent maple syrup urine disease (intermittent MSUD) is a mild
      form of MSUD where patients (when well) are asymptomatic with normal levels
      of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) but with catabolic stress are at risk
      of acute decompensation with ketoacidosis which can lead to cerebral edema and
      coma if untreated.
