  TextSection:
    Contents: Intermittent maple syrup urine disease (intermittent MSUD) is a mild
      form of MSUD (see this term) where patients (when well) are asymptomatic with
      normal levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) but with catabolic stress
      are at risk of acute decompensation with ketoacidosis which can lead to cerebral
      edema and coma if untreated.
