  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by the presence of multiple café-au-lait
      macules and elevated rates of sister chromatid exchange demonstrated on cytogenetic
      testing. Pre- and postnatal growth deficiency with short stature microcephaly
      mild developmental delay cardiomyopathy and symptomatic gastro-esophageal reflux
      have also been described while malar rash is typically absent.
