  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited human prion disease characterized by adult onset of
      progressive disturbance and loss of circadian rhythms dysautonomia with increased
      sympathetic activity and cognitive impairment with fluctuating vigilance impaired
      long-term memory disorientation and oneiric states. Motor disturbances include
      myoclonus cerebellar ataxia and pyramidal signs. The disease rapidly leads to
      a somnolent or comatose state and is typically fatal after 9 or 30 months on
      average (bimodal course). Neuropathologic examination shows marked neuronal
      loss and gliosis predominantly in thalamic nuclei and inferior olives while
      deposition of abnormal prion protein may be relatively sparse.
