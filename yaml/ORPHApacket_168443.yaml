  TextSection:
    Contents: Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia-hypotrichosis syndrome is a rare primary
      bone dysplasia disorder characterized by congenital hypotrichosis associated
      with rhizomelic short stature (more pronounced in upper limbs than lower limbs)
      limited hip abduction and mild genu varum. Flared and irregular metaphyses delayed
      and irregular epiphiseal ossification and pear-shaped vertebral bodies are characteristic
      radiologic findings.
