  TextSection:
    Contents: Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix is a very rare slow growing
      well-differentiated epithelial neoplasm of the appendix characterized by abundant
      mucin production. Clinically it presents as acute appendicitis (with abdominal
      pain fever leukocytosis) or as pseudomyxoma peritonei (wide-spread presence
      of mucin within the peritoneal cavity) however some patients may be completely
      asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. In many cases a second gastrointestinal
      malignancy is present.
