  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by late onset of
      mild progressive proximal muscle weakness severe myalgias during and after exercise
      and susceptibility to rhabdomyolysis. Intellectual disability is mild or absent.
      There are no abnormalities of the skin. Muscle biopsy shows focal depletion
      of mitochondria especially at the center of muscle fibers surrounded by enlarged
      mitochondria at the periphery.
