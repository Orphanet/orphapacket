    Contents: A rare primary immunodeficiency disorder due to impaired capacity of
      activated T- and B-cells to proliferate in response to antigen receptor-mediated
      activation characterized by early-onset severe persistent and/or recurrent viral
      infections due to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Varicella Zoster virus (VZV including
      generalized varicella) as well as recurrent sino-pulmonary bacterial infections
