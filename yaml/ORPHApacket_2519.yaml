  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by microcephaly intellectual disability seizures and congenital heart defects
      (e.g. atrial/ventricular septal defect hypoplastic aortic arch with persistent
      ductus arteriosus). Additional manifestations include mild hypothyroidism skeletal
      abnormalities micropenis delayed psychomotor development dysmorphic facial features
      (including epicanthus depressed nasal bridge prominent antitragus) and pulmonary
      vascular occlusive disease. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1989.
