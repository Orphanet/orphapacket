  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare organic aciduria characterized by neonatal onset of hypotonia
      recurrent apneic episodes lack of psychomotor development feeding difficulties
      extrapyramidal signs and seizures. Other reported features include microcephaly
      sensorineural deafness bradycardia and neutropenia. Laboratory studies show
      increased serum lactate and urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid. Brain
      imaging may reveal progressive cerebral atrophy. The disease is lethal in infancy.
