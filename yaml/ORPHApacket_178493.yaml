  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic macular disorder characterised by severe near-sightedness
      resulting from continual elongation of the eyeball. As the eyeball stretches
      the sclera and retina thin and the macula can tear causing bleeding beneath
      the retina. It is a major cause of irreversible vision loss.
