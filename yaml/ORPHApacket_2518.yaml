    Contents: A rare neuro-opthalmological disease characterized by severe microcephaly
      of prenatal onset (with diminutive anterior fontanelle and sutural ridging)
      growth retardation global developmental delay and intellectual disability (ranging
      from mild to profound) dysmorphic features (sloping forehead micro/retrognathia
      prominent ears) and visual impairments (including microphthalmia to anophtalmia
      generalized retinopathy or multiple punched-out retinal lesions retinal folds
      with retinal detachment optic nerve hypoplasia strabismus nystagmus). Brain
      MRI may show reduced cortical size cerebral hemispheres corpus callosum pachygyria
      symplified gyral folding or normal pattern. Other associated features include
      epilepsy and neurological deficits.
