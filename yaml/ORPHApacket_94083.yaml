  TextSection:
    Contents: Partington syndrome is a form of syndromic X-linked mental retardation
      (S-XLMR) characterised by the association of mild to moderate intellectual deficit
      dysarthria and dystonic hand movements. So far less than 20 cases have been
      described in the literature. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the Aristaless-related
      homeobox (<i>ARX</i>) gene (Xp22.13). Transmission is X-linked recessive.
