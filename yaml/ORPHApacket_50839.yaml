  TextSection:
    Contents: Cat-scratch disease is a rare infectious disease caused by the Gram-negative
      bacteria <i>Bartonella henselae</i> that is transmitted to humans via a scratch
      or bite of an infected cat and that has a variable clinical presentation but
      that usually manifests with an erythematous papule at the site of inoculation
      followed by chronic regional lymphadenopathy. Clinical course is usually self-limiting
      but disseminated illness with high fever hepatosplenomegaly granulomatous osteolytic
      lesions encephalitis retinitis and atypical pneumonia can also occur. Cat-scratch
      disease can atypically present as parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (unilateral
      conjunctivitis and preauricular lymphadenopathy).
