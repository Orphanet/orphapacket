  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic non-severe combined immunodeficiency disorder characterized
      by variable B- and T-cell defects (including defective B-cell differentiation
      and impaired T-cell proliferation to mitogens and bacterial antigens) and natural
      killer cell dysfunction (ranging from impaired cytotoxicity to lymphopenia)
      due to IL21R deficiency manifesting with recurrent respiratory and/or gastrointestinal
      tract infections and in some cases with severe chronic progressive cholangitis
      and liver cirrhosis associated with cryptosporidial infection.
