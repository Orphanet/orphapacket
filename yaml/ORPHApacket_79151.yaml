  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic acrokeratoderma disease characterized by multiple symmetrical
      asymptomatic skin-colored (rarely brownish) flat-topped wart-like papules located
      on the dorsal aspects of the hands and feet (occasionally found on other parts
      of the body such as knees elbows and forearms) typically associated with palmoplantar
      punctate keratosis and variable nail involvement (including leukonychia thickening
      ridging longitudinal striations and splitting). Histology reveals undulating
      hyperkeratosis papillomatosis hypergranulosis and acanthosis creating a characteristic
      'church spire' appearance with no acantholysis nor dyskeratosis associated.
