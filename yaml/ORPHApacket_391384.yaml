    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral neuropathy characterized by recurrent stereotyped
      episodic intense pain ocurring predominantly in either the upper body or lower
      limbs in several members of a family which is triggered or exacerbated by fatigue
      cold exposure fasting weather changes and/or physical stress or exertion and
      may or may not diminish with age. Sweating and other manifestations such as
      tachycardia breathing difficulties and generalized pallor may be associated.
