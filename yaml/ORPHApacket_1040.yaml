  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of metaphyseal dysplasia characterized by short stature
      rhizomelic micromelia and a mild varus deformity of the legs evident from the
      first months of life that is associated with radiological features of severe
      metaphyseal changes (irregularities widening and marginal blurring) in long
      bones most prominent in proximal femurs and generalized osteopenia and that
      usually spontaneously resolves by the age of three years. Severe autosomal dominant
      and milder recessive variants have been observed.
