    Contents: Polymicrogyria with optic nerve hypoplasia is a rare genetic syndrome
      with central nervous system malformations characterized by severe developmental
      delay neonatal hypotonia seizures optic nerve hypoplasia and distinct central
      nervous system malformations including extensive bilateral polymicrogyria dysplastic
      or absent corpus callosum and malformed brainstem with loss of demarcation of
      the pontomedullary junction.
