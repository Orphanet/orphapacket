  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic disease characterized by congenital multiple contractures
      characteristic craniofacial features (like large fontanel hypertelorism downslanting
      palpebral fissures blue sclerae ear deformities high palate) evident at birth
      or in early infancy and characteristic cutaneous features like skin hyperextensibility
      skin fragility with atrophic scars easy bruising and increased palmar wrinkling.
      Additional features include recurrent/chronic dislocations chest and spinal
      deformities peculiarly shaped fingers colonic diverticula pneumothorax and urogenital
      and ophthalmological abnormalities among others. Molecular testing is obligatory
      to confirm the diagnosis.
