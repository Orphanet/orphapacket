  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of endogenous Cushing syndrome (CS) caused by abnormal production
      of ACTH due in 80% of cases to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) oversecretion
      by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease CD) and in 20% of cases to ectopic ACTH
      secretion (CS due to EAS) by an extrapituitary tumor or very rarely due to a
      tumor secreting both ACTH and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH).
