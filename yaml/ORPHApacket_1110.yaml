  TextSection:
    Contents: A developmental anomaly characterized at birth by the presence of right-sided
      aortic arch craniofacial dysmorphism (microcephaly asymmetric facial bones broad
      forehead borderline hypertelorism nasal septum deviation large nasal cavity
      large posteriorly rotated ears and microstomia with downturned corners) and
      intellectual disability. These features were observed in 4 members of one family
      involving 2 successive generations suggesting an autosomal dominant mode of
      transmission. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1968.
