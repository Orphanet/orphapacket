  TextSection:
    Contents: Tetrasomy 21 is an extremely rare autosomal anomaly resulting from the
      presence of 4 copies of chromosome 21 characterized by features of trisomy 21
      including developmental delay/intellectual disability muscular hypotonia short
      neck with redundant skin brachycephaly microcephaly flat face epicanthus upslanted
      palpebral fissures small ears protruding tongue single transverse palmar crease
      brachydactyly hypoplastic iliac wings together with additional features such
      as prematurity intrauterine growth retardation high and broad forehead hypertelorism.
      Haematological malignancies are also associated and may occur earlier than in
      trisomy 21.
