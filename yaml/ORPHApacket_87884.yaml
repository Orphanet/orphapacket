  TextSection:
    Contents: Deafness is the most frequent form of sensorial deficit. In the vast
      majority of cases the deafness is termed nonsyndromic or isolated and the hearing
      loss is the only clinical anomaly reported. In developed counties 60-80% of
      cases of early-onset hearing loss are of genetic origin.
