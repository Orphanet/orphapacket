  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of renal dysplasia (RD) a renal tract malformation characterized
      by abnormal or incomplete development of both kidneys. Bilateral RD can be segmental
      and of variable severity with renal aplasia corresponding to extreme RD. Patients
      may be asymptomatic if the residual kidney function is sufficient. In cases
      of severe bilateral RD the risk of renal failure in childhood is high.
