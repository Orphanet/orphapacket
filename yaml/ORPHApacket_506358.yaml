  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by variable developmental delay and intellectual disability movement disorder
      or gait abnormalities and dysmorphic craniofacial features (such as facial asymmetry
      broad forehead posteriorly rotated ears thick lower lip micrognathia or cleft
      palate). A variety of congenital malformations have been reported in addition
      including ocular renal cardiac and joint anomalies among others. Some patients
      show behavioral alterations (autism hyperactivity or anxiety).
