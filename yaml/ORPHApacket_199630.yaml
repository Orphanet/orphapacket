  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated cerebellar vermis hypoplasia is a rare non-syndromic cerebellar
      malformation characterized by an underdeveloped cerebellar vermis. Patients
      may present a variable phenotype ranging from normal neurodevelopment to motor
      and/or language delay variable degrees of cognitive impairment hypotonia equilibrium
      disturbances static/dynamic ataxia oculomotor abnormalities epilepsy and/or
      clumsiness. Behavioral disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      and generalized anxiety have also been reported. Brain MRI may reveal diffuse
      or selective (mostly posterior) vermian cerebellar hypoplasia and EEG may show
      focal paroxysms.
