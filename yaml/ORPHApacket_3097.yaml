  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome with 46,XY difference of sex development characterized
      by genital abnormalities congenital cardiac malformations and diaphragmatic
      abnormalities. Ambiguous or female external genitalia are present in individuals
      with 46,XY karyotype. Genital abnormalities are variable and may include a true
      double vagina or septate vagina absent uterus abnormal male gonads in the presence
      of normal external female genitalia or male pseudohermaphroditism with abnormal
      internal female genitalia. Complex cyanotic congenital heart defects (hypoplastic
      right lungs anomalous pulmonary venous return and abnormalities of the diaphragm)
      are frequent. Rhabdomyomatous dysplasia of the lungs can also be observed. It
      is a neonatally lethal condition.
