  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuroendocrine neoplasm of pancreas characterized by a high-grade
      malignant epithelial tumor with neuroendocrine differentiation. Based on histopathologic
      appearance a small cell (composed of diffuse sheets of cells) and a large cell
      type (showing a nesting/trabecular pattern) are distinguished. Synaptophysin
      and chromogranin are positive on immunohistochemistry. The Ki-67 proliferation
      index is typically very high (>60 - 80%). Patients present with back pain jaundice
      and/or non-specific abdominal symptoms. Serum hormone activity is unusual. The
      tumor is highly aggressive with poor prognosis.
