  TextSection:
    Contents: Mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome encephalomyopathic form is a group
      of mitochondrial DNA maintenance syndrome diseases characterized by predominantly
      neuromuscular manifestations with typically infantile onset of hypotonia lactic
      acidosis psychomotor delay progressive hyperkinetic-dystonic movement disorders
      external ophtalmoplegia sensosineural hearing loss generalized seizures and
      variable renal tubular dysfunction. It may be associated with a broad range
      of other clinical features.
