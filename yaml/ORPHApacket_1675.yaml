  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of pyrimidine metabolism characterized by a variable
      phenotype ranging from absence of symptoms to severe neurological involvement
      with developmental delay intellectual disability and seizures. Additional signs
      and symptoms may include hypotonia microcephaly ocular abnormalities (such as
      microphthalmia nystagmus and strabismus) and autistic behavior among others.
      Analysis of urine typically shows high levels of uracil and thymine. Patients
      are at risk of suffering from severe toxicity after the administration of the
      anti-neoplastic agent 5-fluorouracil.
