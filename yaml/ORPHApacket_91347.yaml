  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare functioning pituitary adenoma characterized by the presence of
      a pituitary mass associated with high levels of circulating free thyroid hormones
      in conjunction with normal to high levels of TSH and unresponsiveness of TSH
      levels to TRH stimulation and T3 suppression tests typically manifesting with
      signs and symptoms of mild to moderate hyperthyroidism (e.g. goiter (most frequently
      observed) palpitation excessive sweating arrhythmia weight loss tremor) and/or
      tumor mass effect (such as headache visual field defects hypopituitarism). Occasionally
      cosecretion of prolactin and/or growth hormone may cause galactorrhea and/or
      acromegaly.
