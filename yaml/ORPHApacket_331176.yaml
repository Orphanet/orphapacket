  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive severe congenital neutropenia due to G6PC3 deficiency
      is a rare genetic primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by increased
      susceptibility to recurrent life-threatening bacterial infections in association
      with typically severe neutropenia in peripheral blood and bone marrow and a
      prominent ectatic superficial vein pattern resulting from recessively inherited
      mutations in the <i>G6PC3</i> gene. Cardiac malformations (e.g. atrial septal
      defects patent ductus arteriosus,valvular defects) urogenital anomalies (incl.
      cryptorchidism) growth and developmental delay facial dysmorphism (e.g. frontal
      bossing upturned nose malar hypoplasia) and intermittent thrombocytopenia are
      frequently associated.
