  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) defines a group of autoinflammatory
      diseases characterized by recurrent episodes of systemic inflammatory attacks
      in the absence of infection or autoimmune disease. CAPS comprises 3 disorders
      on a continuum of severity: severe CINCA syndrome intermediate Muckle-Wells
      syndrome (MWS) and milder familial cold urticaria (FCAS) (see these terms).'
