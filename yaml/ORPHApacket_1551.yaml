  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial benign copper deficiency is a rare disorder of mineral absorption
      and transport characterized by hypocupremia that manifests as failure to thrive
      mild anemia repeated seizures hypotonia and seborrheic skin. Spurring of the
      femur and tibia are also noted on radiographic imaging. Symptoms are reversible
      or improve with supplements of oral copper. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1988.
