  TextSection:
    Contents: BNAR syndrome is a very rare multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized
      by a bifid nose (see this term) (with bulbous nasal tip but not associated with
      hypertelorism) with or without the presence of anal defects (i.e. anteriorly
      placed anus rectal stenosis or atresia) and renal dysplasia (unilateral or bilateral
      renal agenesis see these terms) and without intellectual disability. BNAR syndrome
      is phenotypically related to Fraser syndrome and oculotrichoanal syndrome (see
      these terms).
