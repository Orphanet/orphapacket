    Contents: Idiopathic syringomyelia is a rare non-syndromic central nervous system
      malformation characterized by a longitudinally oriented fluid-filled cavity
      inside the spinal cord parenchyma or the central canal without any readily identifiable
      cause. It is usually associated with pain sensory and/or musculoskeletal disturbances
      but it can also be an incidental and asymptomatic finding.
