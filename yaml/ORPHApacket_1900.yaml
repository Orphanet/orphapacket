  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome characterized
      by congenital muscle hypotonia congenital or early-onset kyphoscoliosis (progressive
      or non-progressive) and generalized joint hypermobility with dislocations/subluxations
      (in particular of the shoulders hips and knees). Additional common features
      are skin hyperextensibility easy bruising of the skin rupture/aneurysm of a
      medium-sized artery osteopenia/osteoporosis blue sclerae umbilical or inguinal
      hernia chest deformity marfanoid habitus talipes equinovarus and refractive
      errors. Subtype-specific manifestations include skin fragility atrophic scarring
      scleral/ocular fragility/rupture microcornea and facial dysmorphology (like
      low&#8208;set ears epicanthal folds down&#8208;slanting palpebral fissures high
      palate). Molecular testing is obligatory to confirm the diagnosis.
