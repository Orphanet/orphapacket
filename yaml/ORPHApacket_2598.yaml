  TextSection:
    Contents: Mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia belongs to the heterogeneous
      family of metabolic myopathies. It is characterised by progressive exercise
      intolerance manifesting in childhood onset of sideroblastic anaemia around adolescence
      lactic acidaemia and mitochondrial myopathy.
