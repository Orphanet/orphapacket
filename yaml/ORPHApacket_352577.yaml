  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic syndromic intellectual disability disorder with a variable
      phenotypic presentation typically characterized by microcephaly severe feeding
      difficulties failure to thrive severe global development delay that frequently
      results in absent/poor speech moderate to severe intellectual disability and
      hypotonia. Distinctive craniofacial features include prominent forehead high-arched
      thin eyebrows hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures long tubular nose
      with broad tip and prominent nasal bridge and wide mouth with full everted lower
      lip. Joint laxity and ulnar deviation of wrists are also frequently observed.
