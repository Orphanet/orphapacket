  TextSection:
    Contents: Trisomy 5p is a chromosomal abnormality resulting from the duplication
      of a segment of variable size of the short arm of chromosome 5 which usually
      involves the distal band 5p15. The clinical presentation is variable but is
      always associated with severe intellectual deficit.
