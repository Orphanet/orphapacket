  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare syndromic genetic deafness characterized by mild to moderate
      conductive hearing loss dysmorphic pinnae and lip pits or dimples. The pinnae
      are usually small cup-shaped with helix folded forward and hearing loss is associated
      with malformed ossicles and displacement of the external auditory canal.
