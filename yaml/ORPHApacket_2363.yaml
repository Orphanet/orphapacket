  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by hypoplasia aplasia or atresia of the lacrimal system anomalies of the ears
      with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss hypoplasia aplasia or atresia of the
      salivary glands dental anomalies and digital malformations. Patients present
      obstruction of the nasal lacrimal ducts that can lead to epiphora and chronic
      conjunctivitis due to alacrimia. Aplasia or hypoplasia of the salivary glands
      lead to dry mouth and early onset of severe dental caries. Dental features include
      late tooth eruption small and peg-shaped lateral maxillary incisors and mild
      enamel dysplasia. The digital features are variable and include fifth finger
      clinodactyly duplication of the distal phalanx of the thumb triphalangeal thumb
      and/or syndactyly. Unilateral radial aplasia and radial-ulnar synostosis have
      also been reported in association.
