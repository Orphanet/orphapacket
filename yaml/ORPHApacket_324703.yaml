  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by an age of onset between 50-70 years of age recurrent lobar intracerebral
      hemorrhages and cognitive decline. This subtype is due to a mutation in the
      <i>APP</i> gene (21q21.2) encoding the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This
      mutation causes an increased accumulation of amyloid-beta protein in the walls
      of the arteries and capillaries of the meninges cerebellar cortex and cerebral
      cortex leading to the weakening and eventual rupture of these vessels.
