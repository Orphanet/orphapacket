    Contents: 'A form of peeling skin syndrome characterized by a generalized distribution.
      It comprises two sub-types: the non-inflammatory (PSS type A) and the inflammatory
      (PSS type B) form. PSS type A is characterized by generalized white scaling
      with superficial non-inflammatory peeling of the skin while PSS type B is characterized
      by superficial patchy peeling of the entire skin with underlying erythroderma
      pruritus and atopy.'
