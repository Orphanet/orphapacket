  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital complex vascular malformation syndrome characterized
      by capillary malformations manifesting as wine stains and venous varicosities
      typically prominent along the lateral aspect of the lower extremities associated
      with overgrowth of a limb (most commonly a leg less frequently other regions
      of the body) involving bone and/or soft tissues. The diagnosis is usually made
      in presence of at least two of these three features. Lymphatic malformations
      are also observed while arteriovenous fistulas are absent. Patients present
      recurrent painful thrombophlebitis venous thrombosis and sudden venous hemorrhage.
