  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital complex vascular malformation syndrome characterized
      by capillary malformations manifesting as port-wine stains and venous varicosities
      typically prominent along the lateral aspect of the lower extremities associated
      with overgrowth of a limb (most commonly a leg) more rarely other regions of
      the body involving bone and/or soft tissue. The diagnosis is usually made when
      at least 2 of these 3 features exist. Lymphatic malformations are also observed
      while arteriovenous fistulas are absent. Patients present recurrent painful
      thrombophlebitis venous thrombosis and sudden venous hemorrhage.
