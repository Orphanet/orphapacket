  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency (PDHD) is a rare neurometabolic disorder
      characterized by a wide range of clinical signs with metabolic and neurological
      components of varying severity. Manifestations range from often fatal severe
      neonatal lactic acidosis to later-onset neurological disorders. Six subtypes
      related to the affected subunit of the PDH complex have been recognized with
      significant clinical overlap: PDHD due to E1-alpha E1-beta E2 and E3 deficiency
      PDHD due to E3-binding protein deficiency and PDH phosphatase deficiency.'
