  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare thyroid tumor characterized by a malignant neoplasm derived from
      the calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid and occurring
      familially but not as a component of multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes.
      The commonly multifocal bilateral nodules are typically located at the junction
      of the upper and middle thirds of the thyroid lobes. Clinically patients may
      present with diarrhea flushing or weight loss caused by excessive secretion
      of calcitonin by the tumor. In rare cases the tumor can also cause Cushing syndrome
      due to ectopic corticotropin production.
