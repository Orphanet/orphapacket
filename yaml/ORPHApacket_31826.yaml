  TextSection:
    Contents: Ethylene glycol poisoning is a rare poisoning resulting in elevated
      anion gap metabolic acidosis due to the production of glycolic acid glyoxylic
      acid and oxalic acid by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in the liver when ethylene
      glycol is metabolized characterized initially by euphoria slurred speech encephalopathy
      coma and seizures and followed by late manifestations such as tachycardia arrhythmias
      myocardial depression hemodynamic imbalance and finally acute renal failure.
