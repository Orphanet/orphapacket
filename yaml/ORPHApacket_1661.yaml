  TextSection:
    Contents: X-linked corneal dermoid (X-CND) is an exceedingly rare benign congenital
      corneal tumor characterized by bilateral opacification of the cornea with superficial
      grayish layers and irregular raised whitish plaques as well as fine blood vessels
      covering the central cornea and intact peripheral corneal borders. No other
      ocular or systemic abnormality is noted. The pattern of inheritance described
      in the affected family is consistent with X-linked transmission.
