  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cerebellar ataxia characterized by cerebellar inflammation caused
      by viral or bacterial infection-triggered immune-mediated mechanisms. It mainly
      affects young children following an episode of usually viral infection (notably
      varicella) but sometimes also adults mostly upon Epstein-Barr virus or mycoplasma
      infection. Affected individuals mainly present with acute-onset afebrile gait
      ataxia meningeal signs high intracranial pressure with or without extracerebellar
      manifestations (such as clouding of consciousness seizures and altered mental
      status) or extracerebellar focal signs. Mild behavioral changes can also be
      present. Pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid is reported in the majority of the
      patients.
