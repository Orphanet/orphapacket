  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder of lysine and tryptophan metabolism characterized by
      2-aminoadipic and 2-oxoadipic aciduria. Patients may also present with increased
      urinary excretion of alpha-hydroxyadipic acid. Variable clinical presentations
      have been found in patients including hypotonia developmental delay mild to
      severe intellectual disability ataxia epilepsy and behavioral disorders (most
      commonly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). However many individuals
      with the biochemical phenotype are completely asymptomatic and thus the clinical
      significance of the condition is questionable.
