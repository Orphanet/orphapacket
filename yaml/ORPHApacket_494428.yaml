  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia characterized by prominent
      subpleural and parenchymal fibroelastosis and pleural fibrosis predominantly
      involving the upper lobes. Signs and symptoms include non-productive cough dyspnea
      and recurrent respiratory infections. Pneumothorax is a frequently reported
      complication. Pulmonary function test reveals a restrictive pattern and reduced
      diffusing capacity. Computed tomography shows pleural thickening with signs
      of fibrosis (traction bronchiectasis architectural distortion and loss of volume)
      and reticulation.
