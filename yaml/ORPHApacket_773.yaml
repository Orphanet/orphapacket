  TextSection:
    Contents: A metabolic disease characterized by anosmia cataract early-onset retinitis
      pigmentosa and possible neurological manifestations including peripheral neuropathy
      and cerebellar ataxia. Other features can be deafness ichthyosis skeletal abnormalities
      and cardiac arrhythmia. It is characterized biochemically by accumulation of
      phytanic acid in plasma and tissues.
