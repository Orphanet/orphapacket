  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of testicular germ cell tumor occurring in the third decade of
      life with a usually painless unilateral mass in the scrotum or in some cases
      with gynaecomastia and/or back and flack pain. The clinical course is more aggressive
      than testicular seminomatous germ cell tumors with rapid involvement of blood
      vessels and a poorer prognosis. Histologically the tumour can be either undifferentiated
      (embryonal carcinoma) differentiated (teratoma yolk sac tumor choriocarcinoma)
      or can consist of a mixture of seminomatous and nonseminomatous components.
