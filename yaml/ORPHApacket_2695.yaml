  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital nose and cavum anomaly characterized by clefting of
      the nose ranging from a minimally noticeable groove in the columella to complete
      clefting of the underlying bones and cartilage (resulting in two half noses)
      with a usually adequate airway. Bifid nose may be seen in frontonasal dysplasia;
      other malformations such as hypertelorbitism and midline clefts of the lip may
      also be associated.
