  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare T-B+ severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by profoundly
      decreased levels of T-cells normal B-cells and low immunoglobulin levels. The
      thymus is present. Patients typically become symptomatic in infancy or early
      childhood with recurrent infections. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B-cell
      lymphoproliferative syndrome/lymphoma and mucocutaneous-immunodeficiency syndrome
      have been reported in association. Some patients may show developmental delay
      neurocognitive impairment and behavioral dysfunction (in particular attention
      deficit-hyperactivity disorder).
