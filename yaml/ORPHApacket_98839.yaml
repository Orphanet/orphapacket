  TextSection:
    Contents: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a very rare form of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (see this term) characterized by the selective
      growth of lymphoma cells within the lumina of small blood vessels (especially
      the capillaries) that most often presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations
      (as potentially any tissue can be involved) with patients from Western countries
      more frequently manifesting with neurological and cutaneous symptoms while patients
      from Asian countries more frequently displaying hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.
      IVLBCL is characterized by an absence of lymphadenopathy an aggressive clinical
      course and a poor prognosis.
