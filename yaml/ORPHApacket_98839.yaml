  TextSection:
    Contents: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a very rare form of
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by the selective growth of lymphoma
      cells within the lumina of small blood vessels (especially the capillaries)
      that most often presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations (as potentially
      any tissue can be involved) with patients from Western countries more frequently
      manifesting with neurological and cutaneous symptoms while patients from Asian
      countries more frequently displaying hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopenia.
      IVLBCL is characterized by an absence of lymphadenopathy an aggressive clinical
      course and a poor prognosis.
