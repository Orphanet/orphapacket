  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked syndromic intellectual disability characterized by intellectual
      disability of variable degree behavioral anomalies (including autism mood disorders
      obsessive-compulsive behavior and hetero- and auto-aggression) and epilepsy.
      Progressive neurological symptoms like movement disorders and spasticity as
      well as subtle dysmorphic features have also been reported. Heterozygous females
      may be as severely affected as males.
