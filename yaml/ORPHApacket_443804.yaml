  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare stiff person spectrum disorder characterized by painful episodic
      spasms (which are often precipitated by touch pain cold movement or negative
      emotions) increased stimulus sensitivity including hyperekplexia as well as
      stiffness in a lower or upper limb typically with insidious onset and progression
      over months or years. The condition may eventually progress into classic stiff
      person syndrome. Fear of leaving the house and walking unaided is characteristic.
      Most patients have autoantibodies in serum and CSF in particular anti-glutamic
      acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies. In rare cases the syndrome is of paraneoplastic
      origin.
