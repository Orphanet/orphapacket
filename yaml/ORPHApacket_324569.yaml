  TextSection:
    Contents: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 (PCH8) is a novel very rare form of
      pontocerebellar hypoplasia (see this term) characterized clinically by progressive
      microencephaly feeding difficulties severe developmental delay although walking
      may be achieved hypotonia often associated with increased muscle tone of lower
      extremities and deep tendon reflexes joint deformities in the lower extremities
      and occasionally complex seizures. PCH8 is caused by a loss-of-function mutation
      in the <i>CHMP1A</i> gene. MRI demonstrates a pontocerebellar hypoplasia with
      vermis and hemispheres equally affected and mild to severely reduced cerebral
      white matter volume with a fully formed very thin corpus callosum.
