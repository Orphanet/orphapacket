  TextSection:
    Contents: Pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 8 (PCH8) is a novel very rare form of
      pontocerebellar hypoplasia characterized clinically by progressive microencephaly
      feeding difficulties severe developmental delay although walking may be achieved
      hypotonia often associated with increased muscle tone of lower extremities and
      deep tendon reflexes joint deformities in the lower extremities and occasionally
      complex seizures. PCH8 is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <i>CHMP1A</i>
      gene. MRI demonstrates a pontocerebellar hypoplasia with vermis and hemispheres
      equally affected and mild to severely reduced cerebral white matter volume with
      a fully formed very thin corpus callosum.
