  TextSection:
    Contents: Inherited congenital spastic tetraplegia is a rare genetic neurological
      disease characterized by non-progressive variable spastic quadriparesis in multiple
      members of a family in the absence of additional factors complicating pregnancy
      or birth (e.g. perinatal asphyxia congenital infection). Additional clinical
      features include congenital hypotonia intellectual disability and developmental
      delay. Dysphagia dysarthria exotropia nystagmus seizures and brain atrophy with
      ventriculomegaly may be also present.
