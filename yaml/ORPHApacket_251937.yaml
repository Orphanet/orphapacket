  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by slow growth and irregular
      arrangement of neoplastic ganglion cells (large multipolar dysplastic neurons)
      within stroma composed of non-neoplastic glial elements. Most commonly it occurs
      in temporal lobe but it can be located throughout central nervous system. Clinical
      manifestations vary depending on the location and include seizures increased
      intracranial pressure cerebellar signs and focal neurologic deficits. Memory
      disturbances cranial nerve palsies and psychiatric symptoms have also been reported.
