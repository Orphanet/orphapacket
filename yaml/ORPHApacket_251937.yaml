  TextSection:
    Contents: Gangliocytoma is a rare mixed neuronal-glial tumor characterized by
      slow growth and irregular arrangement of neoplastic ganglion cells (large multipolar
      dysplastic neurons) within stroma composed of non-neoplastic glial elements.
      Most commonly it occurs in temporal lobe but it can be located throughout central
      nervous system. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the location and include
      seizures increased intracranial pressure cerebellar signs and focal neurologic
      deficits. Memory disturbances cranial nerve palsies and psychiatric symptoms
      have also been reported.
