  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy characterized by
      hypotonia in infancy variable psychomotor retardation markedly impaired pain
      sensitivity with poorly healing distal ulcerations and painless fractures leading
      to joint deformities and amputation of fingers and toes altered deep tendon
      reflexes and dysautonomic symptoms including hypohidrosis and heat intolerance
      chronic diarrhea pupillary abnormalities or urinary incontinence. Sensorineural
      hearing loss has also been reported. The severity of the disease is highly variable
      with severe cases being potentially lethal in infancy.
