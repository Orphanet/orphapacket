  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal ichthyosis syndrome with prominent neurologic signs
      characterized by the association of congenital ichthyosis with global developmental
      delay intellectual disability infantile-onset seizures and spastic tetraplegia.
      Brain imaging may show delayed myelination and cerebral atrophy. Marked intrafamilial
      variability has been reported.
