      is an inherited epidermal disorder characterized by palmoplantar keratoderma
      linear hyperkeratotic papules on the flexural side of large joints (cord-like
      distribution around wrists in antecubital and popliteal folds) hyperkeratotic
      plaques (on neck axillae elbows wrists and knees) mild ichthyosiform scaling
      and sclerotic constrictions around fingers that present flexural deformities.
