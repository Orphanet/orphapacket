  TextSection:
    Contents: Ulnar hypoplasia-split foot syndrome is characterised by the association
      of severe ulnar hypoplasia absence of fingers two to five and split-foot. It
      has been described in four males belonging to two generations of the same family.
      X-linked recessive inheritance is suggested but autosomal dominant transmission
      cannot be excluded.
