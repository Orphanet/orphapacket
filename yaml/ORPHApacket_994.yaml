  TextSection:
    Contents: The fetal akinesia/hypokinesia sequence (or Pena-Shokeir syndrome type
      I) is characterized by multiple joint contractures facial anomalies and pulmonary
      hypoplasia. Whatever the cause the common feature of this sequence is decreased
      foetal activity.
