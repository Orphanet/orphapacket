  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation disorder characterized
      by a highly variable phenotype. The severe multisystemic disease involves brain
      heart muscles liver kidneys and eyes and results in death in infancy. Mildly
      affected individuals have only isolated cardiac or muscle involvement in the
      adulthood. Histochemical and biochemical analysis reveals a global reduction
      of succinate dehydrogenase activity.
