  TextSection:
    Contents: Mosaic trisomy 20 is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome with a highly
      variable phenotype ranging from normal (in the majority of cases) to a mild
      subtle phenotype principally characterized by spinal abnormalities (i.e. stenosis
      vertebral fusion and kyphosis) hypotonia lifelong constipation sloped shoulders
      skin pigmentation abnormalities (i.e. linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis)
      and significant learning disabilities despite normal intelligence. More severe
      phenotypes with patients presenting psychomotor and speech delay mild facial
      dysmorphism cardiac (i.e. ventricular septal defect dysplastic tricuspid mitral
      valve) and renal anomalies (e.g. horseshoe kidneys) have also been reported.
