  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital chronic diarrhea with protein-losing enteropathy is a rare
      genetic intestinal disease characterized by early-onset chronic non-infectious
      non-bloody watery diarrhea associated with protein-losing enteropathy which
      results in hypoalbuminemia hypogammaglobulinemia and elevated stool alpha-1-antitrypsin.
      Patients typically present severe intractable diarrhea failure to thrive recurrent
      infections and edema.
