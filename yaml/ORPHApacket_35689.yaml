  TextSection:
    Contents: Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS) is an idiopathic non-familial motor
      neuron disease characterized by slowly progressive upper motor neuron dysfunction
      leading to spasticity mild weakness in voluntary muscle movement hyperreflexia
      and loss of motor speech production.
