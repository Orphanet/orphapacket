    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by neonatal or infancy
      onset of delayed motor development generalized muscle weakness involving also
      the facial muscles pseudohypertrophy of lower limb muscles and joint contractures
      associated with childhood onset of rapidly progressive dilated cardiomyopathy
      with arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Muscle biopsy in early childhood
      shows minicore-like lesions and centralized nuclei with dystrophic features
      being more conspicuous in the second decade of life.
