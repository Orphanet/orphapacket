  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia-epilepsy-intellectual disability
      syndrome characterized by early-childhood onset of cerebellar ataxia associated
      with generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy and psychomotor development delay dysarthria
      gaze-evoked nystagmus and learning disability. Other features in some patients
      include upper motor neuron signs with leg spasticity and extensor plantar responses
      and mild cerebellar atrophy on brain MRI.
