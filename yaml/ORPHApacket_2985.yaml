    Contents: A rare syndromic intellectual deficiency characterized by psychomotor
      delay severe progressive spastic quadriplegia microcephaly and a Hallerman-Streiff-like
      phenotype including absence of eyebrows and eyelashes glaucoma and small beaked
      nose. Structural central nervous system abnormalities (cervical spinal cyst
