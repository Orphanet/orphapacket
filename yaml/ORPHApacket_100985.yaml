  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of hereditary spastic paraplegia with high intrafamilial
      clinical variability characterized in most cases as a pure phenotype with an
      adult onset (mainly the 3rd to 5th decade of life but that can present at any
      age) of progressive gait impairment due to bilateral lower-limb spasticity and
      weakness as well as very mild proximal weakness and urinary urgency. In some
      cases a complex phenotype is also reported with additional manifestations including
      cognitive impairment cerebellar ataxia epilepsy and neuropathy. A faster disease
      progression is noted in patients with a later age of onset.
