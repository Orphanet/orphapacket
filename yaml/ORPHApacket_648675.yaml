  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of scleritis characterized by tender or painful violet-blueish
      eye with edema and injection of deep scleral vessels in the absence of infection
      or systemic autoimmune diseases. It can be unilateral or bilateral. Other ocular
      signs depend on the localisation (anterior or posterior) and on the type of
      scleritis (diffuse nodular or necrotizing). Extension to other layers of the
      eye and to peri-ocular tissues as well as visual impairment are potential complications.
      Idiopathic scleritis is more frequent in children than in adults.
