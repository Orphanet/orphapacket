  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 characterized
      by late adult-onset (50-60 years of age) of slowly progressive axonal peripheral
      sensorimotor neuropathy resulting in distal upper limb and proximal and distal
      lower limb muscle weakness and atrophy in conjunction with distal panmodal sensory
      impairment in upper and lower limbs. Tendon reflexes are reduced and nerve conduction
      velocities range from reduced to absent. Neuropathic pain has also been associated.
