  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hepatic disease characterized by recurrence of hepatitis C virus
      infection after liver transplantation leading to liver injury with features
      resembling those observed in the non-transplant graft and typically developing
      after three months post-transplantation. The clinical course is highly variable
      although patients most commonly develop progressive chronic liver disease with
      higher viral loads and more rapid fibrosis progression than in the immunocompetent
      population.
