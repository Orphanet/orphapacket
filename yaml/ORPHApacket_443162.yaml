  TextSection:
    Contents: NDE1-related microhydranencephaly is a rare hereditary syndrome with
      a central nervous system malformation as major feature characterized by extreme
      microcephaly and growth restriction severe motor delay and mental retardation
      and typical radiological findings of gross dilation of the ventricles resulting
      from the absence (or severe delay in the development) of cerebral hemispheres
      hypoplasia of the corpus callosum cerebellum and brainstem. Associated features
      are thin bones and scalp rugae.
