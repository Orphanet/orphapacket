    Contents: Severe early-onset axonal neuropathy due to MFN2 deficiency is a rare
      axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy characterized by early onset
      (<10 years) progressive distal muscle weakness and wasting of the lower limbs
      and later to a lesser extent the upper limbs resulting in foot and wrist drop
      areflexia skeletal deformities (kyphoscoliosis pes cavus with flattening joint
      contractures) mild sensory impairment with vibration sense reduced to a greater
      extent than pain optic atrophy and hearing loss. Wheelchair dependence by adolescence
      is usual and respiratory impairment with diaphragmatic paralysis may develop.
