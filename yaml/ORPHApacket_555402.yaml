    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disease characterized by infantile onset of repeated
      episodes of developmental regression and neurodegeneration often triggered by
      febrile illnesses. Patients present with lethargy hypotonia irritability gait
      ataxia loss of speech movement disorder seizures ophthalmoplegia and hearing
      loss. Brain imaging shows generalized cerebral atrophy and bilateral basal ganglia
      abnormalities. Extensive skin lesions cardiomyopathy and pancytopenia have been
      reported in association. The condition is fatal in the first years of life.
