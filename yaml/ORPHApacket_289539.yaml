  TextSection:
    Contents: BAP1-related tumor predisposition syndrome (TPDS) is an inherited cancer-predisposing
      syndrome associated with germline mutations in BAP1 tumor suppressor gene. The
      most commonly observed cancer types include uveal melanoma malignant mesothelioma
      renal cell carcinoma lung ovarian pancreatic breast cancer and meningioma with
      variable age of onset. Common cutaneous manifestations include malignant melanoma
      basal cell carcinoma and benign melanocytic BAP1-mutated atypical intradermal
      tumors (MBAIT) presenting as multiple skin-coloured to reddish-brown dome-shaped
      to pedunculated well-circumscribed papules with an average size of 5 mm histologically
      predominantly composed of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant amphophilic
      cytoplasm prominent nucleoli and large vesicular nuclei that vary substantially
      in size and shape.
