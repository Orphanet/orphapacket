  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare partial autosomal deletion syndrome characterized by a variable
      phenotype including moderate to severe intellectual disability behavioral problems
      short stature microcephaly dysplastic nails sparse hair cleft palate and dysmorphic
      craniofacial features. The deletion typically includes the gene <i>SATB2</i>
      and patients present with the typical features of SATB2-associated syndrome
      with the addition of a variable pattern of cardiovascular genitourinary and
      ectodermal congenital anomalies due to the involvement of adjacent genes.
