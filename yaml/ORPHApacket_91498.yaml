      fourth cranial nerve palsy manifesting with hypertropia in side gaze unexplained
      head tilt acquired vertical diplopia and progressive increase in vertical fusional
      vergence amplitudes with prolonged occlusion. Facial asymmetry (i.e. hemifacial
      retrusion upward slanting of mouth on the side of the head tilt mild enophthalmos
