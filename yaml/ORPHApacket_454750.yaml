  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital esophageal malformation characterized by the presence
      of an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the trachea (typically occurring
      in the lower cervical or upper thoracic area and taking an oblique path upward
      to trachea) without concomitant esophageal atresia. Depending on the size of
      the lumen presentation varies from neonatal episodes of choking and cyanosis
      on feeding to subtle symptoms of wheezing and recurrent respiratory infections
      in childhood or early adulthood.
