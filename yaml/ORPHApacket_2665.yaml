  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare renal tumor characterized by a unilateral solitary well demarcated
      mesenchymal/myofibroblastic neoplasm occurring in very young children. Histopathologically
      three subtypes (classic cellular and mixed) can be distinguished. The tumor
      most commonly involves the renal sinus and is typically discovered as a palpable
      abdominal mass. Patients may also present with hypertension or hematuria rarely
      with hypercalcemia or hyperreninemia. Prenatal presentation usually with polyhydramnios
      is not infrequent. The most important prognostic factor is completeness of surgical
      resection. Overall malignant potential is low and clinical outcome favorable.
