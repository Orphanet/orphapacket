  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized
      by varying degrees of caudal dysgenesis ranging from a single umbilical artery
      or imperforate anus to full sirenomelia in several members of the same family.
      Phenotype includes lumbosacral agenesis anal atresia or ectopia genitourinary
      abnormalities components of VATER or VACTERL association and facial dysmorphism
      (flat facies abnormal ears bilateral epicanthic folds depressed nasal bridge
      micrognathia). Additional features reported include cardiovascular (e.g. endocardial
      cushion defect hypoplasia of pulmonary artery) and skeletal (kyphosis hemipelvis)
      anomalies.
