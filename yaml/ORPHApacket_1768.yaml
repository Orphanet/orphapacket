  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial caudal dysgenesis is a rare genetic developmental defect during
      embryogenesis disorder characterized by varying degrees of caudal dysgenesis
      ranging from a single umbilical artery or imperforate anus to full sirenomelia
      in several members of the same family. Phenotype includes lumbosacral agenesis
      anal atresia or ectopia genitourinary abnormalities components of VATER or VACTERL
      association and facial dysmorphism (flat facies abnormal ears bilateral epicanthic
      folds depressed nasal bridge micrognathia). Additional features reported include
      cardiovascular (e.g. endocardial cushion defect hypoplasia of pulmonary artery)
      and skeletal (kyphosis hemipelvis) anomalies.
