  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome characterized by neonatal blisters and milia (small
      white papules especially on the face) and congenital absence of dermatoglyphics
      on the hands and feet. It has been reported in two kindreds (one of which contained
      13 affected individuals spanning three generations) and in an unrelated individual.
      Some affected patients also showed bilateral partial flexion contractures of
      the fingers and toes and webbing of the toes. The syndrome is inherited as an
      autosomal dominant trait.
