  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disorder of urea cycle metabolism typically characterized
      by either a severe neonatal-onset form that manifests with hyperammonemia accompanied
      with vomiting hypothermia lethargy and poor feeding in the first few days of
      life or late-onset forms that manifest with stress- or infection-induced episodic
      hyperammonemia or in some behavioral abnormalities and/or learning disabilities
      or chronic liver disease. Patients often manifest liver dysfunction.
