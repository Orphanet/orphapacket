  TextSection:
    Contents: Transient neonatal multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency describes
      a very rare condition where a maternal riboflavin deficiency causes an infant
      to present with manifestations similar to those seen in multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
      (MAD) deficiency such as poor suck metabolic acidosis and hypoglycemia but that
      resolves completely with oral riboflavin. In the one patient described haploinsufficiency
      of the human riboflavin transporter (hRFT1) was described in the mother.
