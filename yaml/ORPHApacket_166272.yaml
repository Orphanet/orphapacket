  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by the association of spondylometaphyseal
      dysplasia generalized joint laxity and dentinogenesis imperfecta. Main skeletal
      abnormalities comprise short stature narrow chest scoliosis mesomelic limb shortening
      and brachydactyly. Radiographic features include severe metaphyseal irregularities
      of the tubular bones platyspondyly with coronal clefts cone-shaped epiphyses
      of the hands square iliac wings and coxa valga. Additional extraskeletal manifestations
      like pulmonary hypoplasia cystic renal disease and non-obstructive hydrocephalus
      have also been reported.
