  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hematologic disease characterized by the transfer of maternal
      alloantibodies against red blood cell antigens of the Kell family to a fetus
      positive for this antigen across the placental barrier causing suppression of
      erythropoiesis with reticulocytopenia and anemia as well as alloimmune hemolysis.
      Severe anemia may lead to hydrops fetalis. Significant hyperbilirubinemia is
      rare in this condition.
