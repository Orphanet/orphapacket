  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature-pituitary and cerebellar defects-small sella turcica syndrome
      is characterised by short stature anterior pituitary hormone deficiency small
      sella turcica and a hypoplastic anterior hypophysis associated with pointed
      cerebellar tonsils. It has been described in three generations of a large French
      kindred. Ectopia of the posterior hypophysis was observed in some patients.
      The syndrome is transmitted as a dominantly inherited trait and is caused by
      a germline mutation within the LIM-homeobox transcription factor <i>LHX4</i>
      gene (1q25).
