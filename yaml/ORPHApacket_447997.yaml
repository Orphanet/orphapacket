  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurometabolic disorder due to serine deficiency characterized
      by neonatal to infantile onset of global developmental delay postnatal microcephaly
      and intellectual disability which may be associated with slowly progressive
      spastic tetraplegia mainly affecting the lower extremities seizures and brain
      MRI findings including thin corpus callosum delayed myelination and cerebral
      atrophy. Additional symptoms include brisk deep tendon reflexes extensor plantar
      responses behavioral abnormalities (such as irritability hyperactivity sleep
      disorder) abnormal hand movements and stereotypy.
