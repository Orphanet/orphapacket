  TextSection:
    Contents: Periventricular nodular heterotopia (PNH) is a brain malformation due
      to abnormal neuronal migration in which a subset of neurons fails to migrate
      into the developing cerebral cortex and remains as nodules that line the ventricular
      surface. Classical PNH is a rare X-linked dominant disorder far more frequent
      in females who present normal intelligence to borderline intellectual deficit
      epilepsy of variable severity and extra-central nervous system signs especially
      cardiovascular defects or coagulopathy. The disorder is generally associated
      with prenatal lethality in males.
