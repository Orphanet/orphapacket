  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hyperthyroidism characterized by hyperemesis gravidarum
      associated with hyperthyroidism due to hypersensitivity of the thyrotropin receptor
      to chorionic gonadotropin in the absence of abnormally high serum chorionic
      gonadotropin levels. Clinical manifestations include severe nausea vomiting
      weight loss tachycardia excessive sweating and hand tremor but no signs of ophthalmopathy.
