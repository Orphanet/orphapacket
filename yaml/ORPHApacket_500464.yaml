  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare head and neck tumor characterized by a malignant epithelial neoplasm
      most commonly arising in the maxillary sinus or nasal cavity occurring as a
      keratinizing a non-keratinizing or a spindle cell (sarcomatoid) type. Patients
      may present with nasal obstruction epistaxis rhinorrhea swelling or (at more
      advances stages) with facial pain and/or paralysis diplopia and proptosis. Patients
      with paranasal sinus tumors present later and at a higher stage than patients
      with nasal cavity carcinomas. Risk factors are smoking and industrial exposures.
      High-risk HPV is most frequently associated with the non-keratinizing type.
