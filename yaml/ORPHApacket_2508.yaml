  TextSection:
    Contents: Corpus callosum agenesis-abnormal genitalia syndrome is a rare genetic
      developmental defect during embryogenesis syndrome characterized by agenesis
      of the corpus callosum mild to severe neurological manifestations (intellectual
      disability developmental delay epilepsy dystonia) and urogenital anomalies (hypospadias
      cryptorchidism renal dysplasia ambiguous genitalia). Additionally skeletal anomalies
      (limb contractures scoliosis) dysmorphic facial features (prominent supraorbital
      ridges synophris large eyes) and optic atrophy have been observed.
