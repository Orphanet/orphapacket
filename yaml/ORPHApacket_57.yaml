  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease due to aldolase A deficiency is an extremely
      rare glycogen storage disease (see this term) characterized by hemolytic anemia
      with or without myopathy or intellectual deficit. Myopathy can be severe enough
      to result in fatal rhabdomyolysis in some patients. A family with episodic rhabdomyolysis
      (triggered by fever) without hemolytic anemia has recently been reported.
