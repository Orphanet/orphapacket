  TextSection:
    Contents: Cleft lip/palate-deafness-sacral lipoma syndrome is characterised by
      cleft lip/palate profound sensorineural deafness and a sacral lipoma. It has
      been described in two brothers of Chinese origin born to non consanguineous
      parents. Additional findings included appendages on the heel and thigh or anterior
      sacral meningocele and dislocated hip. The mode of inheritance is probably autosomal
      or X-linked recessive.
