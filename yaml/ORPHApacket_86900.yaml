  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare dendritic cell tumor characterized by a neoplasm composed of
      spindle to ovoid cells with phenotypic features similar to those of interdigitating
      dendritic cells. Solitary lymph node involvement is common although extranodal
      localization (in particular skin and soft tissue) has also been reported. Patients
      usually present with an asymptomatic mass sometimes with systemic symptoms such
      as fatigue fever and night sweats. Generalized lymphadenopathy splenomegaly
      or hepatomegaly may be seen in rare cases. The clinical course is generally
      aggressive.
