    Contents: Optic atrophy-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare hereditary
      syndromic intellectual disability characterized by developmental delay intellectual
      disability and significant visual impairment due to optic nerve atrophy optic
      nerve hypoplasia or cerebral visual impairment. Other common clinical signs
      and symptoms are hypotonia oromotor dysfunction seizures autism spectrum disorder
      and repetitive behaviors. Dysmorphic facial features are variable and nonspecific.
