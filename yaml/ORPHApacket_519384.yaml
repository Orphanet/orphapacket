  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare structural developmental eye defect characterized by a persistent
      cyst replacing the eye due to partial or complete failure of the invagination
      of the optic vesicle during the fetal period. If the failure of invagination
      is only partial dysplastic ocular structures may be present. The wall of the
      cyst is composed of connective tissue lined by neuroglial material. The defect
      is usually unilateral and may be an isolated finding or occur in association
      with intra- or extraocular malformations.
