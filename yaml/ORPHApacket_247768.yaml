  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome with 46,XX difference of sex development characterized
      by Müllerian duct hypoplasia or agenesis associated with clinical and biological
      evidence of hyperandrogenism in 46,XX females. Patients present with hypoplastic
      or absent uterus variable abnormalities of other reproductive organs primary
      amenorrhea acne hirsutism and sometimes renal anomalies. External genitalia
      and secondary sexual characteristics are normal. Hormonal analysis shows variably
      elevated serum levels of androstenedione dehydroepiandrosterone and/or total
      and free testosterone.
