  TextSection:
    Contents: Coloboma of superior eyelid is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by a typically unilateral partial or full-thickness variably sized
      defect of the superior eyelid ranging from a small notch to complete absence
      of the entire lid which is commonly triangular in shape (with base at eyelid
      margin) and located on the medial third of the lid. It can occur isolated associated
      with other anomalies (e.g. ocular/orbital and facial) or as part of a syndrome.
