    Contents: Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is a focal childhood epilepsy characterized by
      seizures consisting of unilateral facial sensory-motor symptoms with electroencephalogram
      (EEG) showing sharp biphasic waves over the rolandic region. It is an age-related
      epilepsy with excellent outcome.
