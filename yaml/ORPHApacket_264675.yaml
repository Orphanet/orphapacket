  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic interstitial lung disease due to mutations in the CSF2R
      (colony-stimulating factor 2 receptor) alpha or beta subunits and characterized
      by alveolar accumulation of pulmonary surfactant presenting a highly variable
      clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic to severe respiratory failure.
      Characteristic lung biopsy findings include periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular
      eosinophilic material enlarged foamy alveolar macrophages and well-preserved
      alveolar walls. The Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
      receptor function is impaired but GM-CSF receptor autoantibodies are absent.
