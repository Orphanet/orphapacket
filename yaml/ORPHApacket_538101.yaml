    Contents: A rare congenital autosomal recessive axonal hereditary motor and sensory
      neuropathy disease characterized by axonal neuropathy manifesting at birth or
      shortly thereafter with generalized muscular hypotonia prominently distal muscular
      weakness respiratory/swallowing difficulties and diffuse areflexia associated
      with central nervous system involvement which includes progressive microcephaly
      seizures and global developmental delay. Additional variable manifestations
      include hearing impairment ocular lesions skeletal anomalies (e.g. talipes equinovarus
      overriding toes scoliosis joint contractures) cryptorchidism and dysmorphic
      features (such as coarse facies hypertelorism high-arched palate). Outcome is
      typically poor due to respiratory insufficiency and/or aspiration pneumonia.
