  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal dominant multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized
      by facial dysmorphism (flat facial profile with normal calvarium hypertelorism
      small downslanting palpebral fissures hypoplastic nose with button tip and slitlike
      nares and small pursed mouth) profound sensorineural deafness ulnar deviations
      and contractures of the hand. This disorder is allelic to Waardenburg syndrome
      and distinguished by the imaging findings and distinct facial features.
