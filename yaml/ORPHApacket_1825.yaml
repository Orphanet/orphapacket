  TextSection:
    Contents: Epiphyseal dysplasia-hearing loss-dysmorphism syndrome is a rare multiple
      congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by developmental delay
      intellectual disability short stature sensorineural hearing impairment facial
      dysmorphism (incl. epicanthus broad depressed nasal bridge broad fleshy nasal
      tip mildly anteverted nares deep nasolabial folds broad mouth with thin upper
      lip) and skeletal anomalies (incl. abnormally placed thumbs brachydactyly scoliosis
      dysplastic carpal bones). Patients also present severe behavior disturbances
      (aggression hyperactivity) as well as hypopigmented skin lesions and hypoplastic
      digital patterns. There have been no further descriptions in the literature
      since 1992.
