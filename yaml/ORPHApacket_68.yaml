  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease caused by free-living amoebae belonging to
      the <i>Acanthamoeba</i> <i>Naegleria</i> and <i>Balamuthia</i> genera that are
      able to survive in an autonomous state in all natural environments and can also
      parasitize humans. In immunosuppressed individuals <i>Acanthamoeba</i> genus
      contamination leads to granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (also reported in
      association with species of the <i>Balamuthia</i> genus) together with other
      problems including cardiac cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations all of which
      influence the prognosis. In immunocompetent individuals the <i>Naegleria fowleri</i>
      species is responsible for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis the evolution
      of which is rapidly fatal.
