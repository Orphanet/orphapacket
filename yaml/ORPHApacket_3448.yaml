  TextSection:
    Contents: Weaver-Williams syndrome is a multiple congenital anomalies syndrome
      characterized by moderate-to-severe intellectual disability decreased muscle
      mass microcephaly facial dysmorphism (prominent ears midfacial hypoplasia small
      mouth and cleft palate) clinodactyly of the fingers delayed osseous maturation
      and generalized bone hypoplasia. The syndrome has been described in a brother
      and sister and an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance has been suggested.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1977.
