  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare lysosomal disease characterized by dysmorphic features and skeletal
      changes restricted joint mobility short stature and hand deformities (such as
      claw hands stiffness of hands carpal tunnel syndrome inability to make fists).
      Most patients have normal intellectual capacity and the clinical progression
      is less rapid than that of mucolipidosis type II (MLII).
