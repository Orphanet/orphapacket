  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare familial cardiomyopathy characterized by left ventricular enlargement
      and/or reduced systolic function preceded or accompanied by significant conduction
      system disease and/or arrhythmias including bradyarrhythmias supraventricular
      or ventricular arrhythmias. Disease onset is usually in early to mid-adulthood.
      Sudden cardiac death may occur and may be the presenting symptom. In some cases
      it is associated with skeletal myopathy.
