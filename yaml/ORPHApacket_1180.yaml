  TextSection:
    Contents: A very rare autosomal recessive slowly progressive neurodegenerative
      disorder characterized by the triad of cerebellar ataxia (that generally manifests
      at adolescence or early adulthood) chorioretinal dystrophy which may have a
      later onset (up to the fifth-sixth decade) leading to variable degrees of visual
      impairment and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (delayed puberty and lack of secondary
      sex characteristics). Ataxia-hypogonadism-choroidal dystrophy syndrome belongs
      to a clinical continuum of neurodegenerative disorders along with the clinically
      overlapping cerebellar ataxia-hypogonadism syndrome.
