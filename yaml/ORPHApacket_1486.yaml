  TextSection:
    Contents: Lethal congenital contracture syndrome type 1 is a rare genetic arthrogryposis
      syndrome characterized by total fetal akinesia (detectable since the 13th week
      of gestation) accompanied by hydrops micrognathia pulmonary hypoplasia pterygia
      and multiple joint contractures (usually flexion contractures in the elbows
      and extension in the knees) leading invariably to death before the 32nd week
      of gestation. Lack of anterior horn motoneurons severe atrophy of the ventral
      spinal cord and severe skeletal muscle hypoplasia are characteristic neuropathological
      findings with no evidence of other organ structural anomalies.
