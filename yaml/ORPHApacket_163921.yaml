  TextSection:
    Contents: Posttransplant acute limbic encephalitis is a rare acquired non-paraneoplastic
      limbic encephalitis disorder that develops in the setting of treatment-related
      immunosuppression typically after allogeneic hemapoietic stem cell transplantation
      characterized by onset of confusion headache anterograde amnesia seizures and/or
      loss of consciousness 2-6 weeks following transplantation. Bilateral non-enhancing
      T2 hyperintensities in limbic structures are observed on magnetic resonance
      imaging. Mild cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and syndrome of inappropriate
      antidiuretic hormone secretion may also be associated.
