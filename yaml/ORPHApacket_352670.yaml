  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy disorder characterized
      by the typical CMT phenotype (slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness
      in upper and lower limbs distal sensory loss in extremities reduced or absent
      deep tendon reflexes and foot deformities) with nerve biopsy demonstrating demyelinating
      and axonal changes and nerve conduction velocities varying from the demyelinating
      to axonal range.
