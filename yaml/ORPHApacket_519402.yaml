  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare ophthalmic disorder characterized by an abnormally large optic
      disc (greater than 2.1 mm in diameter). The anomaly is usually bilateral with
      otherwise normal configuration of the disc and typically associated with an
      increased cup-to-disc ratio a round or horizontal oval optic cup and an intact
      pale-appearing neuroretinal rim. In a less frequent variant a unilateral anomalous
      superior excavation obliterates part of the adjacent neuroretinal rim. In general
      visual acuity and visual fields are normal except for an enlarged blind spot.
      Ciliary arteries are more common in megalopapilla.
