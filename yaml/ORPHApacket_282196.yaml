    Contents: A group of rare endocrine diseases characterized by autoimmune activity
      against more than one endocrine organ with possible additional involvement of
      non-endocrine organs. Autoimmunity is typically directed against different target
      antigens in different tissues. The two more common autoimmune polyendocrine
      syndromes (APS) APS type 1 and type 2 have a strong genetic background and have
      Addison's disease as a major feature. The group furthermore includes APS type
      3 and type 4.
