    Contents: A rare epidermal disease characterized by multiple usually asymptomatic
      yellowish to flesh colored hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on the palms and
      soles with a preference for the palmar and plantar margins. Histological examination
      shows pronounced orthohyperkeratosis overlying a crateriform depression in the
      epidermis with hypergranulosis and mild acanthosis while elastorrhexis is absent.
      The lesions appear in the second or third decade of life and gradually increase
      in number over several years. The condition may be sporadic or familial.
