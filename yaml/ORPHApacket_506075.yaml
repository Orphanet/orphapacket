  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuroendocrine tumor of pancreas characterized by a well-differentiated
      epithelial pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm measuring at least 0.5 cm without
      distinct hormonal syndrome. Tumors <0.5 cm are called microadenomas. Microadenomatosis
      is the multifocal occurrence of microadenomas. Histopathologic examination shows
      an organoid growth pattern and expression of synaptophysin and chromogranin
      A on immunohistochemistry. Tumors are often discovered incidentally or patients
      may present with symptoms related to local or metastatic tumor spread. Microadenomas
      are considered benign while larger tumors may behave in a malignant manner with
      extrapancreatic spread metastasis or recurrence.
