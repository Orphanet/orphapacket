  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor characterized by a usually
      encapsulated space-occupying lesion composed of differentiated neoplastic Schwann
      cells. It most commonly arises from peripheral nerves in the head and neck region
      and extensor aspects of the extremities but also from spinal and cranial nerves
      especially the vestibular nerve. The tumor may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms
      related to a mass effect. It grows slowly and only rarely undergoes malignant
      transformation.
