  TextSection:
    Contents: Short stature-valvular heart disease-characteristic facies syndrome
      is characterised by severe short stature with disproportionately short legs
      small hands clinodactyly valvular heart disease and dysmorphism (ptosis high-arched
      palate abnormal dentition). It has been described in a mother and two daughters.
      This syndrome is probably transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
