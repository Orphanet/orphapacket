  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic proximal spinal muscular atrophy characterized by degeneration
      of alpha motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal cord and lower brain
      stem manifesting with onset of severe and progressive muscle weakness in the
      first 6 months of life and presenting with severe generalized hypotonia and
      weakness,. Dysphagia and respiratory impairment may also be present at presentation
      or appear at a later stage. Classically before the advent of recent therapies
      type 1 patients never achieved sitting without support.
