  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic systemic or rheumatologic disease characterized by interstitial
      lung disease (often with pulmonary hemorrhage) and inflammatory arthritis associated
      with high-titer autoantibodies (including anti-nuclear and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic
      antibodies and rheumatoid factor). Patients present from infancy to adolescence
      with tachypnea cough hemoptysis and/or joint pain. Some patients may also develop
      glomerular disease.
