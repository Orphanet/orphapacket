  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of rare self-limited childhood occipital epilepsy characterized
      by focal seizures with autonomic features such as nausea vomiting pallor and
      cardiorespiratory changes in addition to visual disturbances. Patient shows
      a fluctuation in symptoms and awareness during the same seizure event. Seizures
      are typically long lasting. This syndrome is the most common cause of afebrile
      nonconvulsive status epilepticus in childhood. Seizures typically begin between
      the ages of 3 and 6 with remission usually occurring within 2 or 3 years. They
      are usually infrequent however in some patients they can be frequent or disruptive.
      There is no impact on neurodevelopment unlike self-limited childhood focal epilepsies.
