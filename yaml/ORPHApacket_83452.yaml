  TextSection:
    Contents: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a rare neurologic disease painful
      progressive condition that corresponds to a group of disorders characterized
      by a disproportionate spontaneous or stimulus-induced pain accompanied by a
      variably mixed myriad of autonomic and motor disorders including symptoms such
      as swelling allodynia skin blood supply and trophic disturbances. CRPS most
      often affects one of the arms legs hands or feet and usually occurs after an
      injury or trauma to that limb.
