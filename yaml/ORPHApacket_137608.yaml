  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized by progressive
      proportionate asymmetric segmental overgrowth (with soft tissue hypertrophy
      and ballooning effect) that develops and progresses rapidly in early childhood
      arteriovenous and lymphatic vascular malformations lipomatosis and linear epidermal
      nevus (arranged in whorls along the lines of Blaschko). Clinical symptoms of
      Cowden syndrome such as macrocephaly and progressive development of numerous
      hypertrophic hamartomatous and neoplastic lesions involving multiple organs
      and systems are also associated. Patients present an increased risk of developing
      cancer.
