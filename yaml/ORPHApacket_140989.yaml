  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare medium or small vessel vasculitis characterized by focal and/or
      diffuse neurologic symptoms due to a documented arteritic process in the central
      nervous system in the absence of other identified underlying cause (infectious
      systemic other neurologic diseases etc.). It presents with non-specific symptoms
      of headache stroke or transient ischemic attacks with cognitive impairment hemiplegia
      weakness and rarely with cranial nerve involvement seizures and ataxia.
