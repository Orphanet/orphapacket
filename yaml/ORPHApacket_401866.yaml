  TextSection:
    Contents: Childhood-onset spasticity with hyperglycinemia is a rare neurometabolic
      disease characterized by a childhood onset of progressive spastic ataxia associated
      with gait disturbances hyperreflexia extensor plantar responses and non-ketotic
      hyperglycinemia typically revealed by biochemical analysis. Additional signs
      of upper extremity spasticity dysarthria learning difficulties poor concentration
      nystagmus optic atrophy and reduced visual acuity may also be associated.
