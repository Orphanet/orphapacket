  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of localized dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa characterized by
      the development of blisters erosions and lichenoid lesions predominantly in
      the anterior lower legs (pretibial areas and feet) the hands and nails. Individual
      lesions which tend to be papular or plaque-like are often violaceous. Pruritus
      is possible. Healing of blisters is associated with hypertrophic scarring and
      milia formation. Dystrophy of both fingernails and toenails is characteristic.
