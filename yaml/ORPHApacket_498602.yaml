  TextSection:
    Contents: Sugarman brachydactyly is a rare genetic congenital limb malformation
      characterized by brachydactyly of fingers with major proximal phalangeal shortening
      and immobile proximal interphalangeal joints as well as dorsally and proximally
      placed non-articulating great toes (with or without angulation). Radiographic
      findings of hands include bilateral double first metacarpals and biphalangeal
      fifth fingers. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since
      1982.
