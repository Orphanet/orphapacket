  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary inclusion body myopathy type 4 is a rare non-dystrophic myopathy
      characterized by slowly progressive muscular weakness and atrophy initially
      involving proximal lower limbs and hip girdle and later on shoulder girdle proximal
      upper limbs and axial muscles. Ambulation is usually preserved. Congophilic
      inclusions with cytoplasmic inclusions of 15-21 nm filaments on electron microscopy
      are revealed in muscle biopsy.
