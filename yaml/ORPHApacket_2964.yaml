    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis disorder characterized
      by abnormal forward projection of the mandible beyond the standard relation
      to the cranial base with lower incisors often overlapping the upper incisors
      that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Association with mildly everted
