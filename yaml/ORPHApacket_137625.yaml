  TextSection:
    Contents: Glycogen storage disease due to muscle and heart glycogen synthase deficiency
      is characterised by muscle and heart glycogen deficiency. It has been described
      in three siblings (two brothers and their younger sister). The older brother
      died at 10.5 years of age as a result of sudden cardiac arrest and the younger
      brother presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy abnormal heart rate and blood
      pressure during exercise and muscle fatigability. The sister showed no symptoms
      but a lack of glycogen was identified through muscle biopsy. The syndrome is
      caused by homozygous missense mutations in the gene encoding muscle glycogen
      synthase.
