  TextSection:
    Contents: Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disorder of skeletal
      muscle that presents as a hypermetabolic response to potent volatile anesthetic
      gases such as halothane sevoflurane desflurane and the depolarizing muscle relaxant
      succinylcholine and rarely to stresses such as vigorous exercise and heat.
