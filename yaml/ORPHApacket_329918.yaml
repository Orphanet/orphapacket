  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of primary membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis characterized
      by the presence in renal biopsy samples of a glomerulonephritis with sole (or
      at least dominant) glomerular immunofluorescence staining for C3. Non-specific
      alterations or proliferative patterns with C3-dominant glomerular staining are
      also possible. Based upon electron microscopic findings C3 glomerulopathy (C3G)
      may be further classified as C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) or Dense deposit disease
      (DDD).
