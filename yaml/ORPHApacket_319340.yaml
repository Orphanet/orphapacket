  TextSection:
    Contents: Carney complex-trismus-pseudocamptodactyly syndrome is a rare genetic
      heart-hand syndrome characterized by typical manifestations of the Carney complex
      (spotty pigmentation of the skin familial cardiac and cutaneous myxomas and
      endocrinopathy) associated with trismus and distal arthrogryposis (presenting
      as involuntary contraction of distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of
      hands evident only on dorsiflexion of wrist and similar lower-limb contractures
      producing foot deformities).
