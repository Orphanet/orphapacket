  TextSection:
    Contents: Coats disease (CD) is an idiopathic disorder characterized by retinal
      telangiectasia with deposition of intraretinal or subretinal exudates potentially
      leading to retinal detachment and unilateral blindness. CD is classically an
      isolated and unilateral condition affecting otherwise healthy young children.
