  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of congenital cardiac outflow tract anomalies that include such
      defects as tetralogy of Fallot pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect
      double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) double-outlet left ventricle truncus arteriosus
      and transposition of the great arteries (TGA) among others. This group of defects
      is frequently found in patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome . A deletion
      of chromosome 22q11.2 has equally been associated in a subset of patients with
      various types of isolated non-syndromic conotruncal heart malformations (with
      the exception of DORV and TGA where this is very uncommon).
