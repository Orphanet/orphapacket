  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy
      with a variable age of onset characterized by progressive proximal weakness
      and wasting of the shoulder and pelvic musculature (with the pelvic girdle and
      especially the ileopsoas muscle being more affected) and frequent association
      of calf hypertrophy dysphagia arachnodactyly with or without finger contractures
      and/or distal and axial muscle involvement. Additional features include an abnormal
      gait exercise intolerance myalgia fatigue and respiratory insufficiency. Cardiac
      conduction defects are typically not observed.
