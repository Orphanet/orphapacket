  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by multiple small
      yellowish-red or brown papules initially erupting predominantly in the head
      and neck region. The histopathological hallmark of these eventually self-healing
      lesions is a dermal proliferation of histiocytes with intracytoplasmic comma-shaped
      bodies coated vesicles and desmosome-like structures. Birbeck granules are absent.
      The disease typically occurs in young children.
