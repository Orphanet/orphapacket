  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      an abnormal protrusion of the interatrial septum into the right or left atrium
      or both during the cardiorespiratory cycle. The defect may be limited to the
      fossa ovalis or involve the entire septum. It can present as an isolated finding
      but is more often associated with interatrial shunts in particular patent foramen
      ovale. Clinically it increases the risk of peripheral arterial embolism and
      stroke.
