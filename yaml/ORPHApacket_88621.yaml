  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndromic congenital ichthyosis characterized by premature birth
      (at gestational weeks 30-32 in general) in addition to thick caseous and desquamating
      epidermis neonatal respiratory asphyxia and persistent eosinophilia. After the
      perinatal period a spontaneous improvement in the health of affected patients
      is observed and skin features (vernix caseosa-like scale) evolve into a mild
      presentation of flat follicular hyperkeratosis with atopy.
