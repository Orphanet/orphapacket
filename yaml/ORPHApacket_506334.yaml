  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disorder with multisystemic involvement and glomerulopathy characterized
      by progressive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome typically associated with
      focal segmental glomerulosclerosis as well as primary adrenal insufficiency
      with adrenal calcifications. Age of onset and disease course are variable with
      some cases presenting as severe fetal hydrops while most patients present in
      infancy or early childhood and progress to end-stage renal disease within a
      few years. Additional features include ichthyosis primary hypothyroidism hypogonadism
      immunodeficiency and neurological manifestations (such as cognitive impairment
      ataxia sensorineural hearing loss or seizures).
