    Contents: Type I xanthinuria a type of classical xanthinuria (see this term) is
      a rare autosomal recessive disorder of purine metabolism (see this term) characterized
      by the isolated deficiency of xanthine dehydrogenase causing hyperxanthinemia
      with low or absent uric acid and xanthinuria leading to urolithiasis hematuria
      renal colic and urinary tract infections while some patients are asymptomatic
      and others suffer from kidney failure. Less common manifestations include arthropathy
