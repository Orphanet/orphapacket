  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare disease that occurs after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant and is a reaction of donor immune cells against host tissues. Activated
      donor T cells damage host epithelial cells after an inflammatory cascade that
      begins with the preparative regimen.
