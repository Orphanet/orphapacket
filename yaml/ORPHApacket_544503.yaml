  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by congenital microcephaly infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy and profound
      developmental delay. Additional reported features include cortical visual impairment
      sensorineural hearing loss increased muscle tone limb contractures scoliosis
      and dysmorphic features like midface hypoplasia narrow forehead short nose narrowed
      nasal bridge and small chin. Brain imaging may show thin corpus callosum and
      delayed myelination.
