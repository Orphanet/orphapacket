  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal monosomy 10p is a rare chromosomal disorder in which the tip
      of the short arm (p arm) of chromosome 10 is deleted resulting in a variable
      phenotype depending on the size of the deletion. The deletion may involve only
      the terminal 10p15 band or extend towards the centromere to bands 10p14 or 10p13.
