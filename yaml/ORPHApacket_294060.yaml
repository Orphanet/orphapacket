  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare genetic disorders characterized by the presence of joint
      contractures and multiple soft tissue webs (pterygia) across the neck and various
      joints as well as typical facial appearance and a variety of other congenital
      anomalies. Both lethal (lethal and X-linked lethal multiple pterygium syndrome)
      and non-lethal (autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant multiple pterygium
      syndrome) forms occur.
