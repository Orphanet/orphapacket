  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by severe paralysis of the limbs
      and the oral structures causing the person to be completely dependent on help
      in all activities of daily living and communication while having preserved cognition.
      Most commonly the term locked-in syndrome (LIS) is used when the condition is
      caused by acquired brain injury (as in this text) but sometimes also when referring
      to the advanced stage of certain neurodegenerative disorders.
