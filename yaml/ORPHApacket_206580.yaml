  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by proximal muscle
      weakness with an early involvement of foot and hand muscles following normal
      motor development in early childhood a rapidly progressive disease course leading
      to generalized areflexic tetraplegia with contractures severe scoliosis hyperlordosis
      and progressive respiratory insufficiency leading to assisted ventilation. Cranial
      nerve functions are normal and tongue wasting and fasciculations are absent.
      Milder phenotype with a moderate generalized weakness and slower disease progress
      was reported.
