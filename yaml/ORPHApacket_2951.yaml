    Contents: An exceedingly rare autosomal recessive immune disease characterized
      by thumb aplasia short stature with skeletal abnormalities and combined immunodeficiency
      described in three sibships from two possibly related families. The skeletal
      abnormalities included unfused olecranon and the immunodeficiency manifested
      with severe chickenpox and chronic candidiasis. No new cases have been reported
      since 1978.
