  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare constitutional hemolytic anemia due to an enzyme disorder characterized
      by severe glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (typically <10% residual
      enzyme activity) associated with chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia of
      highly variable severity. Patients are at risk of developing neonatal jaundice
      (potentially leading to kernicterus) gallstones and reticulocytosis and splenomegaly.
      They have an increased susceptibility to oxidizing agents provoking episodes
      of acute hemolysis. Favism which describes the occurrence of an acute hemolytic
      reaction in response to the ingestion of fava beans is more common in infants
      and young children.
