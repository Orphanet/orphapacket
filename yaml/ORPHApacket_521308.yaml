    Contents: A rare syndromic frontonasal dysplasia characterized by distinctive
      facial dysmorphic features including hypertelorism almond-shaped palpebral fissures
      nasal deformity with creased ridge depressed or absent tip and asymmetry and
      partial absence of nasal bones and downturned corners of the mouth. Additional
      reported manifestations are limb anomalies (e. g. Poland anomaly transverse
      limb agenesis and anomalies of the hands and feet such as camptodactyly oligodactyly
      clinodactyly and syndactyly) frontonasal encephalocele choanal atresia congenital
      renal/cardiac malformations and corpus callosum agenesis.
