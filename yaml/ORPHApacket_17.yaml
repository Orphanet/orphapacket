  TextSection:
    Contents: Fatal infantile lactic acidosis with methylmalonic aciduria is a rare
      neurometabolic disease characterized by infantile onset of severe encephalomyopathy
      lactic acidosis and elevated methylmalonic acid urinary excretion. Clinically
      it manifests with severe psychomotor delay hypotonia failure to thrive feeding
      difficulties and dystonia. Epilepsy and multiple congenital anomalies may be
      associated.
