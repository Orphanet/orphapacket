  TextSection:
    Contents: Systemic monochloroacetate poisoning is a rare life-threatening intoxication
      with monochloroacetic acid (mainly through the skin but also by inhalation or
      ingestion). It is characterized by vomiting diarrhea and central nervous system
      (CNS)-excitability (disorientation delirium convulsions) as early signs of systemic
      poisoning followed by CNS-depression coma and cerebral edema. Additional signs
      include heart involvement (severe myocardial depression shock arrhythmias nonspecific
      myocardial damage) severe metabolic acidosis hypokalemia hypocalcemia and progressive
      renal failure leading to anuria. Myoglobinemia and leukocytosis may occur. Manifestations
      may be delayed for 1-4 hours.
