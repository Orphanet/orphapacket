  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare acute myeloid leukemia characterized by primary differentiation
      to basophils. Microscopically peripheral blood and bone marrow blasts contain
      coarse cytoplasmic basophilic granules which are positive with metachromatic
      staining (toluidine blue). Electron microscopy confirms that granules show features
      characteristic of basophil precursors. Mature basophils are usually sparse.
      Patients may present with manifestations related to bone marrow failure as well
      as hepatosplenomegaly cutaneous involvement lytic lesions and hyperhistaminemia.
      The disease is associated with a poor prognosis.
