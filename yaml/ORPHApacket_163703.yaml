  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare potentially fatal  epileptic encephalopathy characterized by
      explosive-onset of recurrent multifocal and bilateral tonic-clonic seizures
      following an unspecific febrile illness. The syndrome develops without a clear
      acute structural toxic or metabolic cause in a patient without previous epilepsy.
      FIRES is a subgroup of new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) and requires
      a preceding febrile infection as a mandatory feature.
