  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurovascular malformation characterized by sac-like
      bulging of cerebral arteries due to weakening of the endothelial layer. Familial
      occurrence is suspected when two or more affected first- to third-degree relatives
      are present in a family. Aneurysms may remain asymptomatic throughout life or
      rupture and thereby cause potentially life-threatening subarachnoid hemorrhage.
      Patients with familial cerebral saccular aneurysm are more likely to develop
      more than one brain aneurysm are at greater risk of rupture and tend to have
      poorer outcome after rupture than patients with sporadic cerebral aneurysms.
