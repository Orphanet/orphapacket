    Contents: A rare endocrine disease characterized by a miniature adult type of
      congenital adrenal hypoplasia (residual adrenal cortex is composed of a small
      amount of permanent adult cortex with normal structural organization) selective
      absence of pituitary luteinizing hormone in otherwise normal brain and neonatal
