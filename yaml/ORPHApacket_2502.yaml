    Contents: Metaphyseal dysostosis-intellectual disability-conductive deafness syndrome
      is characterised by metaphyseal dysplasia short-limb dwarfism mild intellectual
      deficit and conductive hearing loss associated with repeated episodes of otitis
      media in childhood. It has been described in three brothers born to consanguineous
      Sicilian parents. Variable manifestations included hyperopia and strabismus.
