  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare X-linked cerebellar ataxia characterized by a combination of
      upper and lower motor neuron signs with an age of onset in the first or second
      decade slow progression and normal intelligence. Typical features of cerebellar
      dysfunction include gait and limb ataxia intention tremor dysmetria dysdiadochokinesia
      dysarthria nystagmus and hyperreflexia. Further phenotypic features are pes
      cavus scoliosis muscle atrophy and peripheral sensory and motor nerve abnormalities.
