  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by neonatal to
      infantile onset of hypotonia developmental delay regression of motor skills
      with distal amyotrophy ataxia and spasticity absent speech or dysarthria and
      moderate to severe cognitive impairment. Optic atrophy may also be associated.
      Brain imaging shows cerebellar atrophy and thin corpus callosum as well as brain
      iron accumulation in the pallidum and substantia nigra beginning during the
      second decade of life.
