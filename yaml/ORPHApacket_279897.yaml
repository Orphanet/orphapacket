    Contents: Primary oculocerebral lymphoma is a rare primary organ-specific extranodal
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (typically diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) simultaneously
      affecting the intraocular compartments (retina vitreous optic nerve uvea and
      others) and the central nervous system (commonly the cerebellum spinal cord
      or pia mater). The presenting symptoms vary depending on the localization of
      the tumor and may include vitreous floaters or blurred vision raised intracranial
      pressure (headache vomiting papilledema) and/or focal neurological deficits.
