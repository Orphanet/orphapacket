  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare monoclonal gammopathy characterized by renal proximal tubule
      dysfunction secondary to monoclonal kappa light chain deposits in proximal tubular
      cells. Clinical presentation is with variable chronic kidney disease low molecular
      weight proteinuria aminoaciduria hyperphosphaturia uricosuria bicarbonaturia
      and non-diabetic glycosuria. Renal phosphate and urate wasting may cause hypophosphatemia
      and hypouricaemia.
