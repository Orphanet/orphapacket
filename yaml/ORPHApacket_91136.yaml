  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare monoclonalgammopathy characterized by renal proximal tubule dysfunction
      secondary to monoclonal kappa light chain deposits in proximal tubular cells.
      Clinical presentation is with variable chronic kidney disease low molecular
      weight proteinuria aminoaciduria hyperphosphaturia uricosuria bicarbonaturia
      and non-diabetic glycosuria. Renal phosphate and urate wasting may cause hypophosphatemia
      and hypouricaemia.
