    Contents: A rare neurologic disease characterized by impaired ability to execute
      complex coordinated movements underlying the production of speech leading to
      highly unintelligible speech in the absence of muscular or sensory deficits.
      Initial presentation may be a severe expressive speech delay. Later characteristic
      features are inconsistent errors on consonants and vowels in repeated productions
      of syllables or words lengthened and disrupted coarticulatory transitions between
      sounds and syllables and inappropriate prosody.
