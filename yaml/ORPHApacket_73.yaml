  TextSection:
    Contents: Gorham-Stout disease (GSD) is a rare disease of massive osteolysis associated
      with proliferation and dilation of lymphatic vessels. GSD may affect any bone
      in the body and can be monostotic or polyostotic. Symptoms at presentation are
      dependent upon the location(s) of the disease; the most common symptom is localized
      pain. The disease may be discovered after a pathological fracture.
