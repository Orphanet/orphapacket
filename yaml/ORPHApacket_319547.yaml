  TextSection:
    Contents: "Mendelian susceptibily to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete\
      \ interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFN-gammaR2) deficiency is a genetic variant\
      \ of MSMD (see this term) characterized by a complete deficiency in IFN-gammaR2\
      \ leading to an undetectable response to IFN-gamma and consequently to severe\
      \ and often fatal infections with bacillus Calmette-Gu\xE9rin (BCG) and other\
      \ environmental mycobacteria (EM)."
