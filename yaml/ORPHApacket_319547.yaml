  TextSection:
    Contents: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to complete
      interferon gamma receptor 2 (IFN-gammaR2) deficiency is a genetic variant of
      MSMD characterized by a complete deficiency in IFN-gammaR2 leading to an undetectable
      response to IFN-gamma and consequently to severe and often fatal infections
      with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) and other environmental mycobacteria (EM).
