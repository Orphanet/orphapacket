  TextSection:
    Contents: "Subacute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (SIDP) is a subacute\
      \ progressive symmetric sensorial and/or motor disorder characterized by muscular\
      \ weakness with impaired sensation absent or diminished tendon reflexes and\
      \ elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins. SIDP is an intermediate form\
      \ between Guillain-Barr\xE9 syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating\
      \ polyneuropathy (CIDP; see these terms)."
