  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic developmental defect during embryogenesis characterized
      by the association of the classic features of Joubert syndrome (congenital midbrain-hindbrain
      malformations causing hypotonia abnormal breathing and eye movements ataxia
      and cognitive impairment) together with the skeletal anomalies of Jeune asphyxiating
      thoracic dystrophy (short ribs long and narrow thorax causing respiratory failure
      short-limbs short stature and polydactyly). Additional variable manifestations
      include cystic kidneys liver fibrosis and retinal dystrophy.
