    Contents: Nonspherocytic haemolytic anaemia due to hexokinase deficiency is characterised
      by severe hemolysis appearing in infancy. Seventeen affected families have been
      reported so far. Transmission is autosomal recessive. Mutations have been described
      in <i>HK1</i> the gene that encodes red blood cell-specific hexokinase-R.
