    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by severe intrauterine growth retardation profound microcephaly dysmorphic craniofacial
      features (such as craniosynostosis and distinctive facial appearance with short
      palpebral fissures broad and beaked nose microstomia micrognathia low-set ears
      and short neck) and variable malformations of the limbs especially the arms.
      Cardiac gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies have also been reported.
      Brain imaging shows gray and white matter abnormalities and hypoplastic or absent
      corpus callosum. The disease is commonly fatal in the fetal to neonatal period
      due to respiratory failure.
