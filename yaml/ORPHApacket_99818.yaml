  TextSection:
    Contents: Turcot syndrome with polyposis or Turcot syndrome type 2 is a form of
      familial adematous polyposis characterized by the concurrence of thousands of
      colonic adenomatous polyposis or colorectal cancer (CRC) and a primary central
      nervous system tumor (principally medulloblastoma). It is also associated with
      pigmented ocular fundus lesions.
