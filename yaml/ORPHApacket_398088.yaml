  TextSection:
    Contents: Hereditary cryohydrocytosis with normal stomatin is a rare hereditary
      hemolytic anemia due to a red cell membrane anomaly characterized by fatigue
      mild anemia and pseudohyperkalemia due to a potassium leak from the red blood
      cells. A hallmark of this condition is that red blood cells lyse on storage
      at 4 degrees centigrade.
