    Contents: A rare genetic cause of hypertension characterized by severe early-onset
      therapy-resistant hypertension due to a gain-of-function mutation in the mineralocorticoid
      receptor. The condition is associated with suppressed plasma renin activity
      and low serum aldosterone levels and is markedly exacerbated during pregnancy.
