  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive complex spastic paraplegia characterized
      by upper motor neuron involvement and peripheral neuropathy with an onset between
      childhood and early adulthood. Patients present with progressive spasticity
      hyperreflexia and distal upper and lower muscle wasting. Reduced cognitive functioning
      and cerebellar ataxia have also been reported. MR imaging may reveal cerebellar
      and/or spinal cord atrophy.
