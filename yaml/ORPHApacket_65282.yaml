  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic ectodermal dysplasia syndrome characterized by woolly
      hair (presenting at birth) palmoplantar keratoderma (developing in the first
      year of life) and dilated cardiomyopathy with predominant left ventricle involvement
      (developing in childhood) which can lead to life-threatening heart failure in
      childhood or adolescence.
