  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated lissencephaly type 1 without known genetic defects belongs
      to the genetically heterogeneous group classic lissencephaly (see this term).
      It is a diagnosis of exclusion when neither associated malformations nor family
      history are present and in the absence of mutations of genes known to be involved
      in classic lissencephaly. Clinically patients present with the common features
      of classic lissencephaly such as developmental delay intellectual disability
      and seizures.
