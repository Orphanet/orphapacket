  TextSection:
    Contents: Isolated lissencephaly type 1 without known genetic defects belongs
      to the genetically heterogeneous group classic lissencephaly. It is a diagnosis
      of exclusion when neither associated malformations nor family history are present
      and in the absence of mutations of genes known to be involved in classic lissencephaly.
      Clinically patients present with the common features of classic lissencephaly
      such as developmental delay intellectual disability and seizures.
