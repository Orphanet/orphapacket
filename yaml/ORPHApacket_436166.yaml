  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic systemic or rheumatologic disease characterized by neonatal
      or infantile onset of enterocolitis (which resolves with age) periodic fever
      and episodes of severe systemic inflammation which may be precipitated by infections
      stress or fatigue. Signs and symptoms include splenomegaly urticaria-like rashes
      arthralgia and myalgia. Associated laboratory findings are elevated inflammatory
      markers (such as ferritin C-reactive protein) pancytopenia and elevated transaminases.
      If left untreated flares can progress to coagulopathy organ failure and death.
