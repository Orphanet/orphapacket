  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial progressive hyperpigmentation is a rare genetic skin pigmentation
      anomaly disorder characterized by irregular patches of hyperpigmented skin which
      present at birth or in early infancy and increase in size number and confluence
      with age. Affected areas of the body include the face neck trunk and limbs as
      well as the palms soles oral mucosa and conjunctiva. No hypopigmentation macules
      are observed and no systemic diseases are associated.
