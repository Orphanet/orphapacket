    Contents: A rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency characterized by
      susceptibility to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative disorders
      such as malignant B-cell proliferation Hodgkin lymphoma B-cell lymphoma lymphoid
      granulomatosis hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and smooth muscle tumor. Patients
      present persistent symptoms of infectious mononucleosis including recurrent
      febrile episodes lymphadenopathies and hepatosplenomegaly accompanied by high
      EBV viral load in the blood. Additional manifestations are autoimmune diseases
      like hemolytic anemia or renal disease.
