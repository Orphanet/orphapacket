  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare <i>PIK3CA</i>-related overgrowth syndrome disease characterized
      by segmental and progressive overgrowth predominantly involving the adipose
      tissue or a mixture of adipose and fibrous tissue with variable involvement
      of subcutaneous and muscular tissue as well as skeletal overgrowth. Overgrowth
      severity and range is highly variable although frequently it is asymmetric and
      disproportionate it affects lower extremities more than the upper ones and progresses
      in a distal to proximal pattern. Congenital overgrowth is typically associated.
