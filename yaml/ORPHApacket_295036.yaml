  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by permanent and manually
      irreducible lateral dislocation of the kneecap. It typically presents with flexion
      contracture of the knee genu valgus absent or dysplastic trochlear groove of
      the femur external rotation of the tibia and dysfunction of the extensor mechanism.
      The defect may be unilateral or bilateral and can occur as an isolated malformation
      be associated with other malformations of the lower limb or be part of a polymalformative
      syndrome.
