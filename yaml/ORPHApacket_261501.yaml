    Contents: A rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome resulting from the partial deletion
      of the short arm of chromosome X principally characterized by classical Norrie
      disease (bilateral severe retinal malformations and opacity of the lens leading
      to congenital blindness on occasion associated with progressive sensorineural
      deafness and intellectual disability) microcephaly hypotonia psychomotor and
      growth delay moderate to severe mental handicap and disruptive behaviour. Clinical
