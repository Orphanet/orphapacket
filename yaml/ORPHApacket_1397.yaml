  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare developmental defect during embryogenesis malformation syndrome
      characterized by congenital non-communicating hydrocephalus cerebellar agenesis
      and absence of the Luschka and Magendie foramina. Patients present with hypotonia
      areflexia or hyporeflexia seizures and/or cyanosis shortly after birth. The
      condition is fatal in the neonatal period. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1978.
