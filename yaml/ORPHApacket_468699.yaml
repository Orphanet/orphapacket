  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital disorder of glycosylation characterized by infantile
      onset of global developmental delay severe intellectual disability hypotonia
      and variable additional features including short stature cranial asymmetry seizures
      strabismus recurrent infections and osteopenia among others. Laboratory analysis
      reveals decreased blood levels of zinc and manganese as well as an abnormal
      serum transferrin glycosylation pattern with decreased tetrasialo- and increased
      asialo- monosialo- disialo and trisialo-transferrin consistent with a type II
      congenital disorder of glycosylation. Brain imaging shows cerebellar and/or
      cerebral atrophy.
