  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by childhood-onset
      severe myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures and early-onset ataxia leading to
      severe gait disturbances associated with normal to slightly diminished cognition.
      Scoliosis diffuse muscle atrophy and subcutaneous fat loss as well as developmental
      delay may be associated. Brain MRI may reveal complete agenesis of the corpus
      callosum ventriculomegaly interhemispheric cysts and simplified gyration (frontally).
