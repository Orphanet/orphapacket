  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by positioning of the heart in the right hemithorax with the base
      and apex of the heart pointing caudally and to the right due to abnormalities
      of embryologic origin that are intrinsic to the heart itself. Situs inversus
      or situs solitus may be associated with extracardiac visceral transposition
      anomalies usually present in the former case and additional cardiac defects
      (e.g. septal defects transposition of the great arteries double-outlet right
      ventricle anomalous pulmonary venous return tetralogy of Fallot) frequently
      observed in both cases.
