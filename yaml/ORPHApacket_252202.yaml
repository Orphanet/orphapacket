  TextSection:
    Contents: "Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome is a rare inherited\
      \ cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by the development of a broad spectrum\
      \ of malignancies during childhood including mainly brain hematological and\
      \ gastrointestinal cancers although embryonic and other tumors have also been\
      \ occasionally reported. Non-neoplastic features in particular manifestations\
      \ reminiscent of neurofibromatosis type 1 (e.g. caf\xE9-au-lait spots freckling\
      \ neurofibromas) as well as premalignant and non-malignant lesions (such as\
      \ adenomas/polpyps) are frequently present before malignancy development."
