  TextSection:
    Contents: Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome is a rare inherited
      cancer-predisposing syndrome characterized by the development of a broad spectrum
      of malignancies during childhood including mainly brain hematological and gastrointestinal
      cancers although embryonic and other tumors have also been occasionally reported.
      Non-neoplastic features in particular manifestations reminiscent of neurofibromatosis
      type 1 (e.g. cafÃ©-au-lait spots freckling neurofibromas) as well as premalignant
      and non-malignant lesions (such as adenomas/polpyps) are frequently present
      before malignancy development.
