    Contents: A rare genetic paroxysmal dystonia disorder characterized by childhood
      to adolescent-onset of episodic paroxysmal choreoathetosis triggered mainly
      by sudden movements prolonged exercise anxiety and emotional stress in association
      with progressive spastic paraparesis (onest in adulthood) gait ataxia mild to
