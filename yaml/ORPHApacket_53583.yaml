  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic paroxysmal dystonia disorder characterized by childhood
      to adolescent-onset of episodic paroxysmal choreoathetosis triggered mainly
      by sudden movements prolonged exercise anxiety and emotional stress in association
      with progressive spastic paraparesis (onest in adulthood) gait ataxia mild to
      moderate cognitive impairment and/or epileptic seizures. Episodes typically
