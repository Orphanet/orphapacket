  TextSection:
    Contents: Familial isolated hypoparathyroidism (FIH) is a rare heterogeneous group
      of metabolic disorders characterized by abnormal calcium metabolism due to deficient
      secretion of parathormone (PTH) without other endocrine disorders or developmental
      defects.
