    TextSectionType: Definition
    Contents: 7p22.1 microduplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from a partial interstitial microduplication of the short arm of chromosome
      7 characterized by intellectual disability psychomotor and speech delays craniofacial
      dysmorphism (including macrocephaly frontal bossing hypertelorism abnormally
      slanted palpebral fissures anteverted nares low-set ears microretrognathia)
      and cryptorchidia. Cardiac (e.g. patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect)
      as well as renal skeletal and ocular abnormalities may also be associated.
