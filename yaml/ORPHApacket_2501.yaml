  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic primary bone dysplasia disease characterized by usually
      moderate postnatal short stature progressive genu vara deformity a waddling
      gait and radiological signs of metaphyseal dysplasia (i.e. irregular sclerotic
      and widened metaphyses) in the absence of biochemical abnormalities suggestive
      of rickets disease. Intermittent knee pain lordosis and delayed motor development
      may also occasionally be associated.
