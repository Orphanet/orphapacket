    Contents: A rare bone development disorder characterized by mostly anterolateral
      bowing of the tibia usually evident at birth with subsequent non-healing fractures
      and formation of a false joint (pseudoarthrosis) and instability and angulation
      at the pseudoarthrosis site. In the vast majority of patients the defect is
      unilateral and more than half of the cases are associated with neurofibromatosis
      type 1.
