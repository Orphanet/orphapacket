  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neurological syndrome characterized by cerebellar ataxia
      neurodevelopmental delay poor motor development and growth mild to severe intellectual
      disability and infantile-onset hypotonia. Many patients have cardiac conduction
      and rhythm anomalies (including bundle branch block bradycardia sinus node dysfunction
      intraventricular conduction delay atrioventricular block and ventricular tachycardia)
      in childhood or adolescence. Additional clinical features may include variable
      ocular anomalies and dysmorphic features.
