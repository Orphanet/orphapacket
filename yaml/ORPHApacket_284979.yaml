  TextSection:
    Contents: Neonatal Marfan syndrome is a rare severe and life-threatening genetic
      disease occuring during the neonatal period characterized by classical Marfan
      syndrome manifestations in addition to facial dysmorphism (megalocornea iridodonesis
      ectopia lentis crumpled ears loose redundant skin giving a 'senile' facial appearance)
      flexion joint contractures pulmonary emphysema and a severe rapidly progressive
      cardiovascular disease (including ascending aortic dilatation and severe mitral
      and/or tricuspid valve insufficiency). Additionally skeletal manifestations
      (arachnodactyly dolichostenomelia pectus deformities) are also associated.
