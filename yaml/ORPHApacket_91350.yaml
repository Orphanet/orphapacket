    Contents: A rare acquired pituitary hormone deficiency characterized by combination
      of headache visual field defects that correlate with cyst size and pituitary
      dysfunction. Most frequent hormonal manifestations are hypogonadism with amenorrhea/impotence
      or low libido and galactorrhea.
