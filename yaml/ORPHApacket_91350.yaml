  TextSection:
    Contents: Pituitary deficiency due to Rathke's cleft cysts is a rare acquired
      pituitary hormone deficiency characterized by combination of headache visual
      field defects that correlate with cyst size and pituitary dysfunction. Most
      frequent hormonal manifestations are hypogonadism with amenorrhea/impotence
      or low libido and galactorrhea.
