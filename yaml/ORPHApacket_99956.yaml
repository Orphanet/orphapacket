  TextSection:
    Contents: Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B2 (CMT4B2) is a subtype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      type 4 characterized by a severe early childhood-onset of demyelinating sensorimotor
      neuropathy early-onset glaucoma focally folded myelin sheaths in the peripheral
      nerves severely reduced nerve conduction velocities and the typical CMT phenotype
      (i.e. distal muscle weakness and atrophy sensory loss and frequent pes cavus).
      Severe visual impairment leading to visual loss has also been reported.
