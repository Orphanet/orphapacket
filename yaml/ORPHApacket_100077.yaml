  TextSection:
    Contents: Jejunal neuroendocrine tumor is a rare primary malignant epithelial
      neoplasm of the small intestine arising from enterochromaffin cells in the jejunum.
      Clinical behavior depends on the histologic grade but initially it is generally
      characterized by vague abdominal symptoms (cramping bloating diarrhea) with
      insidious onset although sometimes it could present with signs of bowel obstruction/perforation
      or gastrointestinal bleeding. Diagnosis in advanced stages with regional or
      distant spread is common but signs of carcinoid syndrome (flushing sweating
      diarrhea) are usually not apparent until hepatic metastasis has occurred.
