  TextSection:
    Contents: Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder characterized by varying degrees
      of deafness and minor defects in structures arising from neural crest including
      pigmentation anomalies of eyes hair and skin. WS is classified into four clinical
      and genetic phenotypes.
