  TextSection:
    Contents: Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) is a form of frontotemporal dementia
      (FTD; see this term) characterized by agrammatism laborious speech alexia and
      agraphia frequently accompanied by apraxia of speech (AOS). Language comprehension
      is relatively preserved.
