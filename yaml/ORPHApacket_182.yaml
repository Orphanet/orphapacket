  TextSection:
    Contents: Chromomycosis is a chronic cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal infection
      found mainly in subtropical and tropical areas (in soil and plant debris and
      transmitted by traumatic inoculation) and characterized clinically by slow growing
      verrucous nodules squamous plaques or chronic limited lesions which are most
      commonly found on the lower limbs and which are characterized histologically
      by the presence of muriform cells. It is caused by dematiaceous fungi with the
      main etiological agents being <i>Fonsecaea pedrosoi</i> <i>Phialophora verrucosa</i>
      and <i>Cladophialophora carrionii</i>. Rarely it can be caused by <i>Rhinocladiella
      aquaspersa</i>.
