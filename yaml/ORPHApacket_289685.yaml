    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a benign subcutaneous lesion
      composed of oval-to-spindle shaped myoid appearing cells with a tendency for
      concentric perivascular growth. The tumor usually presents as a painless slowly
      growing nodule which may be solitary or appear as multiple lesions which then
      arise metachronously and usually involve a particular anatomic region. Recurrence
      after surgical excision may occur in poorly circumscribed tumors. Malignancy
      is very rare.
