  TextSection:
    Contents: Intestinal obstruction in the newborn due to guanylate cyclase 2C deficiency
      is an extremely rare autosomal recessive gastroenterological disorder reported
      in three families so far that is characterized by meconium ileus without any
      further stigmata of cystic fibrosis (see this term) including pulmonary or pancreatic
      manifestations. Two of the reported patients developed chronic diarrhea in infancy.
      Homozygous mutations in the <i>GUCY2C</i> gene (12p12) leading to marked reduction
      or absence of enzymatic activity of guanylate cyclase 2C were found in the affected
      patients. The disease was reported to show partial penetrance.
