    Contents: Hepatic fibrosis-renal cysts-intellectual disability syndrome is a rare
      syndromic intellectual disability characterized by early developmental delay
      with failure to thrive intellectual disability congenital hepatic fibrosis renal
      cystic dysplasia and dysmorphic facial features (bilateral ptosis anteverted
      nostrils high arched palate and micrognathia). Variable additional features
      have been reported including cerebellar anomalies postaxial polydactyly syndactyly
      genital anomalies tachypnea. There have been no further descriptions in the
