  TextSection:
    Contents: Xq12-q13.3 duplication syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome X characterized
      by global developmental delay autistic behavior microcephaly and facial dysmorphism
      (including down-slanting palpebral fissures depressed nasal bridge anteverted
      nares long philtrum down-slanting corners of the mouth). Seizures have also
      been reported in some patients.
