  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive symmetrical
      moderate to severe distal muscle weakness and atrophy without sensory involvement
      first affecting the lower limbs (towards the end of the first decade) and then
      involving (within two years) the upper extremities. Patients typically develop
      foot drop pes varus hammer toes and claw hands. Pyramidal tract signs (such
      as brisk knee reflexes and positive Babinski sign) with absent ankle reflexes
      are initially associated but regress as disease stabilizes (~10 years after
      onset).
