  TextSection:
    Contents: Nasal encephalocele is an extracranial herniation of intracranial contents
      (that maintain a connection to the subarachnoid space) into the fonticulus frontalis
      presenting with nasal broadening and/or as a compressible blue pulsatile mass
      near the nasal bridge (that enlarges on crying or with jugular vein compression)
      or as an intranasal mass originating in the cribiform plate and that can cause
      nasal obstruction or respiratory distress. Hydrocephalus and increased intracranial
      pressure are also reported in some cases.
