  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare benign superficial fibromatosis disease characterized by single
      or multiple uni- or bilateral slow-growing round firm nodules typically located
      on the medial portion of the plantar aponeurosis with no calcification. Patients
      are often asymptomatic or may present with foot pain difficulty to walk or stand
      and rarely toe contractures. Histopathology reveals dense fibrocellular tissue
      with parallel and nodular arrays of fibrocytes and fibrillar collagen with a
      distinctive cork-screw morphology and no atypia.
