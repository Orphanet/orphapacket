  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by mass-forming lesions
      with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells and storiform
      fibrosis often displaying obliterative phlebitis and usually accompanied by
      elevated serum IgG4. Almost any organ may be affected with pancreas salivary
      gland and orbit being the most common. Multi-organ involvement (synchronously
      or metachronously) is typical. Many patients show lymphadenopathy most often
      involving the mediastinal intra-abdominal axillary and cervical nodes. Symptoms
      are usually attributable to the mass effect of the lesions.
