  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital non-syndromic heart malformation characterized by
      the presence of a thin fibromuscular membrane subdividing the left atrium into
      an upper and lower chamber. The upper chamber receives blood from the pulmonary
      veins and the lower chamber is attached to the left atrial appendage. Therefore
      the membrane blocks the orifice of the mitral valve and leads to obstruction
      of the left ventricular inflow. It may be asymptomatic or present in infancy
      with tachypnea dyspnea hemoptysis chest pain syncope pulmonary edema pulmonary
      hypertension or heart failure depending on the degree of obstruction. The anomaly
      may be isolated or associated with other congenital heart anomalies.
