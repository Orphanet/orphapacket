  TextSection:
    Contents: Ogden syndrome is a rare genetic progeroid syndrome characterized by
      a variable phenotype including postnatal growth delay severe global developmental
      delay hypotonia non-specific dysmorphic facies with aged appearance and cryptorchidism
      as well as cardiac arrthymias and skeletal anomalies. Patients typically present
      with widely opened fontanels mainly truncal hypotonia a waddling gait with hypertonia
      of the extremities small hands and feet broad great toes scoliosis and redundant
      skin with lack of subcutaneous fat.
