  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by the association of pancreatic agenesis and lobar/semilobar holoprosencephaly.
      Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and pancreatic exocrine deficiency manifest
      early after birth. Additional reported manifestations include intrauterine growth
      retardation muscle weakness seizures mild intellectual disability and dysmorphic
      craniofacial features and agenesis of the gallbladder.
