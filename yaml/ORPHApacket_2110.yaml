    Contents: Hallux varus-preaxial polysyndactyly syndrome is a rare genetic congenital
      limb malformation disorder characterized by bilateral medial displacement of
      the hallux and preaxial polysyndactyly of the first toes. Radiographs show broad
      shortened misshapen first metatarsals and may associate incomplete or complete
      duplication of proximal phalanges and duplication or triplication of distal
      phalanges. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1980.
