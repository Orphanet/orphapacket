  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare peripheral neuropathy characterized by slowly progressive axonal
      motor greater than sensory polyneuropathy combined with neuromytonia (including
      spontaneous muscular activity at rest (myokymia) impaired muscle relaxation
      (pseudomyotonia) and contractures of hands and feet) and neuromyotonic or myokymic
      discharges on needle EMG. It presents with distal lower limb weakness with gait
      impairment muscle stiffness fasciculations and cramps in hands and legs worsened
      by cold decreased to absent tendon reflexes intrinsic hand muscle atrophy and
      variably mild distal sensory impairment.
