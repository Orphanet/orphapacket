  TextSection:
    Contents: Congenital absence/hypoplasia of fingers excluding thumb unilateral
      is a rare non-syndromic terminal transverse limb reduction defect characterized
      by unilateral absence of the terminal portions of digits 2 to 5 with a mildly
      hypoplastic thumb and small nail remnants on the digital stumps. Metacarpal
      bones may be variably reduced.
