  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare pure or complex form of hereditary spastic paraplegia characterized
      by early adulthood onset of slowly progressive lower limb spasticity resulting
      in gait disturbances hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses urinary urgency
      and/or incontinence muscle weakness decreased vibration sense and mild muscular
      atrophy in lower extremities. It may be associated with complicating signs such
      as sensory neuropathy ataxia (i.e. mild dysmetria uncoordinated eye movement)
      and mild dysphagia.
