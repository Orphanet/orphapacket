    Contents: A rare genetic immune disease characterized by early onset of recurrent
      bacterial viral and fungal infections chronic inflammatory bowel disease gastritis
      and inflammatory polyarthritis. Patients present with diarrhea vomiting hepatosplenomegaly
      mouth ulcers perianal abscesses chronic lung disease with bronchiectasis and
      failure to thrive. Occurrence of a skin rash associated with lymphocytic vasculitis
      has also been reported. Immunologic abnormalities include variable T-cell lymphopenia
      decreased natural killer cells and decreased B-cells with variable hypogammaglobulinemia.
