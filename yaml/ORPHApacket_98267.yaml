  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by early-onset severe obesity due
      to mutations in single genes acting on the development and function of the hypothalamus
      or the leptin-melanocortin pathway leading to disruption of energy homeostasis
      and endocrine dysfunction. Patients present with a body mass index over three
      standard deviations above normal at less than five years of age accompanied
      by a variety of signs and symptoms according to the mutated gene including hyperphagia
      insulin resistance reduced basal metabolic rate or hypogonadism among others.
