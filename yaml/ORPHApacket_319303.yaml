  TextSection:
    Contents: "Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is a rare subtype of renal cell carcinoma\
      \ originating from the intercalating cells of the collecting ducts and macroscopically\
      \ manifesting as a well-circumscribed highly lobulated solid tumor that is usually\
      \ diagnosed at an early stage. It is frequently asymptomatic or may present\
      \ with nonspecific symptoms such as weight loss fever or fatigue. The classic\
      \ presentation observed in renal tumors (hematuria flank pain and palpable mass)\
      \ is occasionally observed and usually indicates an advanced stage of the disease.\
      \ It is most frequently sporadic however several familial cases associated with\
      \ Birt-Hogg Dub\xE9 syndrome have been described."
