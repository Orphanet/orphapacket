  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic polymalformative syndrome characterized by a Noonan-like
      phenotype associated with increased risk of developing juvenile myelomonocytic
      leukemia (JMML). The Noonan-like (NS) phenotype includes dysmorphic facial features
      (i.e. high forehead hypertelorism downslanting palpebral fissures ptosis low-set
      ears prominent philtrum and short neck with or without pterygium colli) developmental
      delay hypotonia and small head circumference. It can be associated with congenital
      heart defects or cardiomyopathy ectodermal anomalies and short stature. The
      NS phenotype is subtle or even inapparent in a large proportion of subjects
      but may occasionally be severe. Leukemia can be the only clinical manifestation
      of the syndrome.
