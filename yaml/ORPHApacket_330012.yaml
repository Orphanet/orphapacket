    Contents: "A rare pulmonary condition characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary\
      \ edema occurring in otherwise healthy individuals within days of an ascent\
      \ above 2500-3000 m. Early symptoms include exertional dyspnea non-productive\
      \ cough chest tightness and reduced exercise performance followed by dyspnea\
      \ at rest and possibly orthopnea as well as gurgling in the chest and pink frothy\
      \ sputum in advanced cases. Clinical signs are cyanosis tachypnea tachycardia\
      \ crackles or wheezing and elevated body temperature (generally not exceeding\
      \ 38.5\xB0C). Signs of concomitant high-altitude cerebral edema may also be\
      \ observed. Chest x-rays typically show patchy opacities predominantly in the\
      \ right middle lobe."
