  TextSection:
    Contents: Lower limb malformation-hypospadias syndrome is a rare developmental
      defect during embryogenesis characterized by severe uni- or bilateral lower
      limb malformations (incl. tibial hypoplasia split and rocker bottom-shaped feet
      and oligosyndactyly) normal upper limbs and hypospadias. Additional dysmorphic
      features (e.g. short neck and low-set large ears) atrial septal defect ureteropelvic
      junction stenosis and slight septation of the spleen have also been reported.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1977.
