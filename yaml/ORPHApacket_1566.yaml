  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital limb malformation characterized by Dandy-Walker malformation
      and postaxial polydactyly. The Dandy-Walker malformation (characterized by posterior
      fossa cyst communicating with the fourth ventricle the partial or complete absence
      of the cerebellar vermis and facultative hydrocephalus) has a variable expression.
      Postaxial polydactyly includes tetramelic postaxial polydactyly of hands and
      feet with possible enlargement of the fifth metacarpal and metatarsal bones
      as well as bifid fifth metacarpals. There have been no further descriptions
      in the literature since 1999.
