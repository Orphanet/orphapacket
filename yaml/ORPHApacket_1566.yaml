  TextSection:
    Contents: Dandy-Walker malformation with postaxial polydactyly syndrome is a syndromic
      disorder with as a major feature the association between Dandy-Walker malformation
      and postaxial polydactyly. The Dandy-Walker malformation has a variable expression
      and is characterized by a posterior fossa cyst communicating with the fourth
      ventricle the partial or complete absence of the cerebellar vermis and facultative
      hydrocephalus. Postaxial polydactyly includes tetramelic postaxial polydactyly
      of hands and feet with possible enlargement of the fifth metacarpal and metatarsal
      bones as well as bifid fifth metacarpals.
