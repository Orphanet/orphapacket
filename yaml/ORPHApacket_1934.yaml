    Contents: A severe form of age-related epileptic encephalopathies characterized
      by the onset of tonic spasms within the first 3 months of life that can be generalized
      or lateralized independent of the sleep cycle and that can occur hundreds of
      times per day leading to psychomotor impairment and death.
