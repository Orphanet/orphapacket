  TextSection:
    Contents: Female restricted epilepsy with intellectual disability is a rare X-linked
      epilepsy syndrome characterized by febrile or afebrile seizures (mainly tonic-clonic
      but also absence myoclonic and atonic) starting in the first years of life and
      in most cases developmental delay and intellectual disability of variable severity.
      Behavioral disturbances (e.g. autistic features hyperactivity and aggressiveness)
      are also frequently associated. This disease affects exclusively females with
      male carriers being unaffected despite an X-linked inheritance.
