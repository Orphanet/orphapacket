  TextSection:
    Contents: 'A rare autoimmune bullous skin disease characterized by mucocutaneous
      bullae with subsequent erosion and formation of vegetative plaques predominantly
      affecting intertriginous areas and the oral mucosa. Two clinical forms of the
      disease are recognized: the Hallopeau type which presents an indolent course
      with pustules healing as vegetative plaques and frequent lack of involvement
      of the oral mucosa and the Neumann type which takes a more severe refractory
      course with vegetations developing during an eruption of vesiculobullous lesions
      and involvement of the oral mucosa. Serum analysis reveals antibodies against
      desmoglein 1 and 3.'
