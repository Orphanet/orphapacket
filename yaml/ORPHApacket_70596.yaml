  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare infectious disease that causes no clinical manifestations in
      the majority of infants. Indeed the occurrence of congenital infection with
      EBV has never been demonstrated conclusively and must be very rare. One case
      have been reported to present after birth multiple congenital anomalies (micrognathia
      cryptorchidism central cataracts) dystrophy generalized hypotonia hepatosplenomegaly
      diffuse petechiae and hematomas and multiple areas of metaphysitis of the long
      bones at birth. A low birth weight was also reported. No specific follow-up
      of the fetus is recommended following maternal EBV primary-infection.
