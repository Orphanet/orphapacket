  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe lateral tibial bowing with short stature is a rare genetic primary
      bent bone dysplasia characterized by significant uni-/bilateral lateral tibial
      bowing localized to the distal two-thirds of the tibia with respective cortical
      thickening and thinning of the inner and outer tibial curve loss of normal trabecular
      bone bilateral abnormalities of the tibial epiphyses and growth plates as well
      as foot abnormalities including abnormally high arches. Affected individuals
      have short stature with absence of other skeletal abnormalities.
