    Contents: Familial supernumerary nipples is a rare breast malformation characterized
      by the presence in various members of a single family of one or more nipple(s)
      and/or their related tissue in addition to the normal bilateral chest nipples.
      The anomaly is usually situated along the embryonic milk line from axillae to
      inguinal regions but other locations are also possible. Association with dental
      abnormalities Becker nevus renal or underlying breast tissue malignancy and
      genitourinary malformations has been reported.
