    Contents: A rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia characterized by temporally
      uniform alveolar and interstitial mononuclear cell inflammation (cellular type)
      and/or fibrosis of the alveolar walls (fibrotic type) with preserved alveolar
      architecture. Other types of interstitial lung disease must be excluded. Symptoms
      are non-specific and include dyspnea cough and often constitutional symptoms
      such as fever and fatigue. Pulmonary function test reveals a restrictive pattern.
      Computed tomography shows predominantly lower lobe subpleural reticular changes
      traction bronchiectasis and ground-glass opacities. The cellular type of the
      disease is less common but carries a better prognosis.
