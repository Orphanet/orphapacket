  TextSection:
    Contents: Severe-immune mediated enteropathy describes a variety of intestinal
      disorders that can range from a serious early-onset systemic disease (IPEX)
      to a mild isolated gastrointestinal disease. In children it manifests with severe
      diarrhea and dehydration in the presence of characteristic antibodies (anti-enterocyte
      and anti-goblet cell) and in adults with chronic diarrhea malabsorption and
      weight loss.
