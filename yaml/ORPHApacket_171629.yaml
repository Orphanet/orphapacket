  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 35 is a rare form of hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by childhood (exceptionally adolescent) onset
      of a complex phenotype presenting with lower limb (followed by upper limb) spasticity
      with hyperreflexia and extensor plantar responses with additional manifestations
      including progressive dysarthria dystonia mild cognitive decline extrapyramidal
      features optic atrophy and seizures. White matter abnormalities and brain iron
      accumulation have also been observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging.
