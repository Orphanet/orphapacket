  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inclusion myopathy characterized by hypotonia and axial muscle
      weakness leading to spinal rigidity and development of scoliosis and other deformities
      which can result in respiratory failure. The symptoms are apparent from birth
      or early childhood. The muscle weakness is not progressive and most patients
      remain ambulatory. Muscle biopsies show variable myopathic changes.
