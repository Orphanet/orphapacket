    Contents: Deafness-intellectual disability syndrome Martin-Probst type is characterised
      by severe bilateral deafness intellectual deficit umbilical hernia and abnormal
      dermatoglyphics. It has been described in three males from three generations
      of one family. Mild facial dysmorphism (telangiectasias hypertelorism dental
      anomalies and a wide nasal root) was also present. Short stature pancytopaenia
      microcephaly and renal and genitourinary anomalies were present in some of the
      patients. The mode of transmission is X-linked recessive and the causative gene
      has been localised to the q1-21 region of the X chromosome.
