  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare leukodystrophy characterized by a spectrum of progressive neurologic
      manifestations comprising rapidly progressive early-onset nystagmus spastic
      tetraplegia and visual and hearing impairment resulting in death in early childhood
      as well as later onset of slowly progressive complex spastic ataxia with pyramidal
      and cerebellar symptoms and loss of developmental milestones. Brain imaging
      shows diffuse hypomyelination of the subcortical and deep white matter cerebellar
      atrophy and diffuse spinal cord volume loss.
