  TextSection:
    Contents: Combined oxidative phosphorylation defect type 2 is a rare mitochondrial
      disorder due to a defect in mitochondrial protein synthesis characterized by
      severe intrauterine growth retardation neonatal limb edema and redundant skin
      on the neck (hydrops) developmental brain defects (corpus callosum agenesis
      ventriculomegaly) brachydactyly dysmorphic facial features with low set ears
      severe intractable neonatal lactic acidosis with lethargy hypotonia absent spontaneous
      movements and fatal outcome. Markedly decreased activity of complex I II + III
      and IV in muscle and liver have been determined.
