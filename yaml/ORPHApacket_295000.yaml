  TextSection:
    Contents: Constriction rings syndrome is a congenital limb malformation disorder
      with an extremely variable clinical presentation characterized by the presence
      of partial to complete congenital fibrous circumferential constriction bands/rings
      on any part of the body although a particular predilection for the upper or
      lower extremities is seen. Phenotypes range from only a mild skin indentation
      to complete amputation of parts of the fetus (e.g. digits distal limb). Compression
      from the rings may lead to edema skeletal anomalies (e.g. fractures foot deformities)
      and infrequently neural compromise.
