  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare non-severe combined immunodeficiency characterized by decreased
      numbers of T cells (particularly CD8+ T cells) and increased susceptibility
      to recurrent infections with variable severity (predominantly respiratory viral
      infections). Additional features may include thymic aplasia/hypolasia skin abnormalities
      including atopic dermatitis hair loss and nail dystrophy. Symptoms may vary
      among patients (some patients may develop serious infections) and may ameliorate
      by age.
