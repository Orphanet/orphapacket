  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized predominantly
      by chorea of variable severity associated with bilateral striatal abnormalities
      on cerebral MRI. The disease is scarcely progressive and cognitive performance
      is preserved in the majority of cases although mild cognitive delay has also
      been reported.
