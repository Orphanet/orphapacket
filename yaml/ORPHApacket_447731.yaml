    Contents: A rare genetic primary combined T and B cell immunodeficiency characterized
      by recurrent severe viral and bacterial infections. Immunologic findings include
      decreased immunoglobulin levels decreased numbers of B and NK cells reduced
      relative CD19+ B cells in peripheral blood impaired memory responses to viral
      infections and defective antigen-specific T-cell proliferation.
