  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by persistently elevated
      serum methionine levels. Half of patients reported with MAT I/III deficiency
      notably those with hypermethioninemia below 800 µM have no CNS abnormalities
      and are clinically asymptomatic. However individuals with higher levels might
      show evidence of central nervous system abnormalities most notably hypo- or
      demyelination on brain MRI as well as developmental delay and intellectual disability.
      Bad breath or a strong smell of urine and sweat may be noted in some patients.
