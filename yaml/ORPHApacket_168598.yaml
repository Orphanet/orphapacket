  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism characterized by persistently elevated
      serum methionine levels. Individuals with mean levels of less than 800 &#956;M
      are usually clinically normal while those with higher means show evidence of
      central nervous system abnormalities most notably hypo- or demyelination on
      brain MRI as well as developmental delay and intellectual disability. Bad breath
      or a strong smell of urine and sweat may be noted in some patients.
