  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypoinsulinemic hypoglycemia and body hemihypertrophy is a rare genetic
      endocrine disease characterized by neonatal macrosomia asymmetrical overgrowth
      (typically manifesting as left-sided hemihypertrophy) and recurrent severe hypoinsulinemic
      (or hypoketotic hypo-fatty-acidemic) hypoglycemia in infancy which results in
      episodes of reduced consciousness and seizures.
