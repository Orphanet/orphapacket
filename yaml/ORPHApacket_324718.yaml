  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by an age of onset of 45 years of age progressive Alzheimer's disease-like dementia
      and lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in some patients. This subtype is due to
      a mutation in the <i>APP</i> gene (21q21.2) encoding the beta-amyloid precursor
      protein. This mutation causes an increased accumulation of amyloid-beta protein
      in the walls of the arteries and capillaries of the meninges cerebellar cortex
      and cerebral cortex leading to the weakening and eventual rupture of these vessels.
