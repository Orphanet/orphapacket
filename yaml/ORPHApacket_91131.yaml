  TextSection:
    Contents: DK1-CDG is characterised by muscular hypotonia and ichthyosis. It has
      been described in four children from two consanguineous families. All the affected
      children died during early infancy two from dilated cardiomyopathy. The syndrome
      is caused by a deficiency in dolichol kinase 1 (DK1) an enzyme involved in the
      <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis of dolichol phosphate. The mutations identified
      in the <i>DK1</i> gene led to a 96 to 98% reduction in DK activity.
