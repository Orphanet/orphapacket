  TextSection:
    Contents: A subtype of autosomal dominant limb-girdle muscular dystrophy characterized
      by an adult-onset of slowly progressive proximal pelvic girdle weakness with
      none or only minimal shoulder girdle involvement and absence of cardiac and
      respiratory symptoms. Mild to moderate elevated creatine kinase serum levels
      and gait abnormalities are frequently observed.
