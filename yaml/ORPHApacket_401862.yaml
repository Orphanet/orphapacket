    Contents: A rare inborn error of metabolism disorder with a highly variable phenotype
      typically characterized by neonatal to infancy-onset of seizures psychomotor
      delay and abnormal muscle tone that may include hypo- and/or hypertonia resulting
      in generalized weakness dystonic movements and/or progressive respiratory distress
      associated with severe lactic acidosis and elevated lactate ketoglutarate and
      2-oxoacids in urine. Additional manifestations may include dehydration vomiting
      signs of liver dysfunction extrapyramidal signs spastic tetraparesis brisk deep
      tendon reflexes speech impairment swallowing difficulties and pulmonary hypertension.
