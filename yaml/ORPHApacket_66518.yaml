  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by the association of unilateral

      the distal end of the fifth metacarpal bone and a tangential line connecting
      the distal ends of the third and fourth metacarpals) insulin resistance and
      spherocytosis. Familial short stature has not been reported as part of the syndrome.
