  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by developmental delay with mild intellectual disability short stature facial
      dysmorphism (such as sparse hair high forehead deep-set eyes short and upslanting
      palpebral fissures short nose anteverted nares wide nasal base with broad nasal
      tip and broad columella long philtrum thin upper lip and low-set posteriorly
      rotated ears) and variable onset of sensorineural hearing loss and retinitis
      pigmentosa. Additional features are other ocular anomalies abnormalities of
      the fingers hypothyroidism and signs of premature aging. Brain imaging shows
      cerebellar atrophy and dysmyelination.
