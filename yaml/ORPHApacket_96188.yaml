  TextSection:
    Contents: Maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 22 is a uniparental disomy
      of maternal origin that does not seem to have an adverse impact on the phenotype
      of an individual. There is a possibility of homozygosity for a recessive disease
      mutation for which the mother is a carrier and specific phenotype depends on
      the inherited disorder.
