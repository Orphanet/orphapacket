    Contents: Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) is a group of primary adrenal
      insufficiencies characterized clinically by neonatal hyperpigmentation hypoglycemia
      failure to thrive and recurrent infections and biochemically by glucocorticoid
      deficiency without mineralocorticoid deficiency.
