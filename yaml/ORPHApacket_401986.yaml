  TextSection:
    Contents: 1p31p32 microdeletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly syndrome
      resulting from the partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 characterized
      by developmental delay corpus callosum agenesis/hypoplasia and craniofacial
      dysmorphism such as macrocephaly (caused by hydrocephalus or ventriculomegaly)
      low-set ears anteverted nostrils and micrognathia. Urinary tract defects (e.g.
      vesicoureteral reflux urinary incontinence) are also frequently associated.
      Other reported variable manifestations include hypotonia tethered spinal cord
      Chiari type I malformation and seizures.
