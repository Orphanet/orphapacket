    Contents: A rare genetic neurological disorder characterized by early onset of
      microcephaly severe global developmental delay and cognitive impairment dyskinesia
      and hyperkinetic movements visual impairment autistic behavior stereotypies
      sleep disturbance epilepsy and cerebral malformations (such as corpus callosum
      hypogenesis forebrain anomaly and delayed myelination). Speech is minimal or
      absent and ambulation is not attained. Patients with a larger 14q12 microdeletion
      show a more severe phenotype than those with intragenic alterations with the
      addition of facial dysmorphism and agenesis of the corpus callosum.
