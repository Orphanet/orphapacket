    Contents: A rare hyperpigmentation of the skin characterized by the presence of
      several café-au-lait macules without any other manifestations of neurofibromatosis
      or any other systemic disorder. The macules may appear in infancy but usually
      they are detected after 2&nbsp;years of age. Hyperpigmented lesions may have
      smooth or irregular borders. Their size vary from a few millimeters to more
      than 10&nbsp;cm.
