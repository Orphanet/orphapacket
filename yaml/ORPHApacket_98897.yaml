  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive external
      ocular facial and pharyngeal muscle weakness leading to variable degrees of
      ptosis ophthalmoparesis facial muscle atrophy dysarthria and dysphagia as well
      as distal muscle weakness and atrophy of lower and upper extremities. Respiratory
      muscle involvement is common but sensorineural hearing loss asymmetrical extremity
      weakness and severe proximal weakness are rare.
