    Contents: A rare non-syndromic uterovaginal malformation characterized by two
      separate uterine cavities and cervices due to failure of the Müllerian ducts
      to fuse. A longitudinal vaginal septum of variable thickness and elasticity
      is also present. Patients may be asymptomatic or experience dyspareunia or dysmenorrhea.
      There is increased frequency of endometriosis as well as fertility and gestational
      issues with significantly reduced chances of seeing a pregnancy to term. The
      condition may be associated with renal agenesis.
