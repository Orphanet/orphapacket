  TextSection:
    Contents: Fetal encasement syndrome is a rare lethal developmental defect during
      embryogenesis characterized by severe fetal malformations including craniofacial
      dysmorphism (abnormal cyst in the cranial region hypoplastic eyeballs two orifices
      in the nasal region separated by a nasal septum abnormal orifice replacing the
      mouth) omphalocele and immotile hypoplastic limbs encased under an abnormal
      transparent membrane-like skin. Additional features include absence of adnexal
      structures of the skin on the outer aspect of the limbs as well as underdeveloped
      skeletal muscles and bones. Association with tetralogy of Fallot horse-shoe
      kidneys and diaphragm and lung lobulation defects is reported.
