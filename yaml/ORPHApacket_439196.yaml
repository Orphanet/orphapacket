    Contents: A rare skin disease characterized initially by erythematous patches
      with superficial necrosis at later stages by hyperkeratotic plaques with a rim
      of dusky erythema of exclusively acral distribution with a predilection for
      the lower extremities and universal association with hepatitis C virus infection.
      Patients typically experience pruritus or pain. Serum zinc levels may or may
      not be decreased although oral zinc supplementation often improves the condition.
