  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare epilepsy syndrome characterized by onset of epileptic spasms
      in infants between 2 and 12 months of age and rarely up to 24 months. Infants
      may have no antecedent history or a history reflecting the underlying cause.
      The classical triad of epileptic spasms hypsarrhythmia and developmental stagnation
      or regression is historically referred to as West syndrome.
