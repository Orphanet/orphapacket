  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic hepatorenal fibrocystic syndrome characterized by cystic
      dilatation and ectasia of renal collecting tubules and a ductal plate malformation
      of the liver resulting in congenital hepatic fibrosis. Clinical presentation
      whilst typically in utero or at birth is variable and in the most severe cases
      includes Potter-sequence oligohydramnios pulmonary hypoplasia and massively
      enlarged echogenic kidneys.
