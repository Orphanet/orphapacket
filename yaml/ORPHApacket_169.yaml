    Contents: A rare isolated benign hair shaft abnormality usually presenting after
      the age of 2 and affecting the hair of the scalp or very rarely beard axillary
      or pubic hair. Hair is characterized by a banded or speckled appearance due
      to alternating light bands (corresponding to air-filled cavities within the
      cortex of the affected hair shafts) and dark bands. The bands have a lifelong
      duration may only be detectable under light microscopy are more apparent in
      fair-colored hair or with age-related graying and have no effect on hair growth
      or fragility in the vast majority of cases.
