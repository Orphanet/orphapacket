  TextSection:
    Contents: 'Plasmacytoma is a localized mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells
      that represents approximately 5% of all plasma cell neoplasms. There are two
      separate entities: primary plasmacytoma of the bone and extramedullary plasmacytoma
      of the soft tissues. Of the extramedullary plasmacytomas 80% occur in the head
      and neck usually in the upper respiratory tract. The median age at diagnosis
      is 50 years and the male to female ratio is 3:1. Long-term survival is possible
      following local radiotherapy particularly for soft tissue presentations.'
