  TextSection:
    Contents: Autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia type 76 is a rare complex hereditary
      spastic paraplegia characterized by adult onset slowly progressive mild to moderate
      lower limb spasticity and hyperreflexia resulting in gait disturbances commonly
      associated with upper limb hyperreflexia and dysarthria. Foot deformities (usually
      pes cavus) and extensor plantar responses are also frequent. Additional features
      may include ataxia lower limb weakness/amyotrophy abnormal bladder function
      distal sensory loss and mild intellectual deterioration.
