  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia with recurrent genetic abnormalities
      characterized by clonal proliferation of poorly differentiated myeloid blasts
      in the bone marrow blood or other tissues in patients who present the t(6;9)(p23;q34)
      translocation. Frequently associated with multilineage bone marrow dysplasia
      it usually presents with anemia thrombocytopenia (often pancytopenia) and other
      nonspecific symptoms related to ineffective hematopoesis (fatigue bleeding and
      bruising recurrent infections bone pain) and/or extramedullary site involvement
      (gingivitis splenomegaly). Basophilia as well as poor response to chemotherapy
      has been reported.
