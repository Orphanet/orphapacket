  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by an age of onset of 20-30 years major systemic amyloidosis and recurrent lobar
      intracerebral hemorrhages. Unlike other forms of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage
      with amyloidosis this subtype is due to a mutation in the <i>CST3</i> gene (20p11.2)
      encoding the precursor protein cystatin C.
