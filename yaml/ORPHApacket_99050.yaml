  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital heart malformation characterized by anomalous origin
      of one branch of the pulmonary arteries directly from the aorta and a normal
      origin of the other pulmonary artery from the main pulmonary artery coming from
      the right ventricular outflow tract. Patients present respiratory distress congestive
      heart failure and failure to thrive within the first days/months of life.
