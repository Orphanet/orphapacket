    Contents: A rare viral hemorrhagic fever characterized by virus-induced microvascular
      leakage rapidly leading to a severe illness with diffuse pulmonary edema and
      respiratory failure. These symptoms set in after a short first disease stage
      with fever myalgia and headache followed by severe gastrointestinal symptoms
      such as abdominal pain vomiting and diarrhea. The high lethality of the disease
      is due to the possible development of hypotension and cardiogenic shock.
