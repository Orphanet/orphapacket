  TextSection:
    Contents: Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (MSMD) due to partial
      IRF8 (interferon regulatory factor 8) deficiency is a rare genetic variant of
      MSMD characterized by a selective susceptibility to relatively mild infections
      with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)..
