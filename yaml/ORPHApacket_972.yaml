    Contents: Hereditary continuous muscle fiber activity is a rare non-dystrophic
      myopathy characterized by generalized myokymia and increased muscle tone associated
      with delayed motor milestones leg stiffness spastic gait hyperreflexia and Babinski
      sign. Symptoms may be worsened by febrile illness or anesthesia.
