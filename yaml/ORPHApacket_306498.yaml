  TextSection:
    Contents: A group rare skin tumor or hamartoma diseases characterized by a germline
      PTEN mutation and clinical manifestations of hamartomas overgrowth and increased
      risk of neoplasia notably breast carcinomas epithelial thyroid carcinomas endometrial
      carcinomas renal cell carcinomas and colorectal carcinoma. Non-malignant manifestations
      include macrocephaly benign thyroid pathology (especially Hashimoto thyroiditis)
      mucocutaneous hamartomas colonic polyps and vascular malformations. Diseases
      in this group include Cowden syndrome Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome Proteus-like
      syndrome Lhermitte-Duclos disease and Segmental outgrowth-lipomatosis-arteriovenous
      malformation-epidermal nevus syndrome.
