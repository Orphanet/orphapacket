  TextSection:
    Contents: Metaphyseal dysplasia-maxillary hypoplasia-brachydactyly syndrome is
      characterized by metaphyseal dysplasia associated with short stature and facial
      dysmorphism (a beaked nose short philtrum thin lips maxillary hypoplasia dystrophic
      yellowish teeth) and acral anomalies (short fifth metacarpals and/or short middle
      phalanges of fingers two and five). It has been described in several members
      spanning four generations of a French-Canadian family. The syndrome is likely
      to be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait.
