  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare inherited epidermolysis bullosa characterized by aplasia cutis
      congenita on the extremities leaving behind hypopigmentation and atrophy in
      a whirled pattern. Generalized blistering persists during childhood and heals
      with cutaneous and follicular atrophy linear and stellate scars and hypopigmentation.
      Skin fragility decreases with adulthood. Adult patients exhibit dyspigmentation
      and atrophy of the skin scars follicular atrophoderma sparse body hair progressive
      diffuse alopecia of the scalp diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma and nail changes.
      Dilative cardiomyopathy with heart failure complicates the disease course in
      young adulthood or later and may have lethal outcome. Ultra-structurally intraepidermal
      splitting appears at the level of the basal keratinocytes above the hemidesmosomes.
