  TextSection:
    Contents: Ichthyosis-oral and digital anomalies syndrome is characterised by ichthyosis
      unusual facies (small mouth with a thin upper lip and lower lip with a midline
      groove) and digital anomalies (tapered fingers with a lack of distal flexion
      creases and wide spacing between the second and third fingers). It has been
      described in two sibs born to first cousin parents. Transmission appears to
      be autosomal recessive.
