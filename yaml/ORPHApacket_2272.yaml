  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by ichthyosis skeletal and digital anomalies (including flexion deformities
      of the large joints proximal interphalangeal joints absent distal flexion crease
      of fingers tapering fingers hypoplastic toes and nails dislocatable ankles)
      and facial dysmorphism (including short forehead epicanthic folds small mouth
      with thin upper lip midline lower lip groove and fullness of the lateral eyelids
      cleft palate can also be present). Additional clinical features may include
      developmental delay generalized hypotonia feeding difficulties recurrent chest
      and gastrointestinal infections. There have been no further descriptions in
      the literature since 1989.
