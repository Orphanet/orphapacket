  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare congenital muscular dystrophy characterized by prominent axial
      hypotonia predominantly proximal muscle weakness in upper limbs and distal in
      lower limbs joint contractures (initially distal later proximal) spinal rigidity
      and progressive respiratory insufficiency in the presence of moderately elevated
      serum creatine kinase. Cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death have also been reported.
