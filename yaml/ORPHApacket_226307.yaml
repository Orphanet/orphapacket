  TextSection:
    Contents: Hypothyroidism due to mutations in transcription factors involved in
      pituitary development or function is a type of central congenital hypothyroidism
      (see this term) a permanent thyroid deficiency that is present from birth characterized
      by low levels of thyroid hormones caused by disorders in the development or
      function of the pituitary.
