  TextSection:
    Contents: Radio-renal syndrome is a rare developmental defect during embryogenesis
      characterized by variable upper limb reduction defects and renal anomalies.
      Patients typically present absence/hypoplasia of digits radii and/or ulnae short
      stature and mild external ear malformation as well as kidney agenesis or ectopia.
      There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1983.
