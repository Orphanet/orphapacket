  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare severe genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by infantile-onset
      of progressive neurodevelopmental regression optic atrophy with nystagmus and
      diffuse white matter disease. Affected individuals usually have central hypotonia
      that progresses to limb spasticity and hyperreflexia eventually resulting in
      a vegetative state. Recurrent chest infections are frequently associated and
      seizures (usually generalized tonic-clonic) may occasionally be observed. Brain
      magnetic resonance imaging shows diffuse bilateral symmetric abnormalities in
      the cerebral periventricular white matter with variable lesions in other areas
      but sparing the basal ganglia.
