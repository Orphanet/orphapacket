  TextSection:
    Contents: Neonatal antiphospholipid syndrome is a rare secondary neonatal autoimmune
      disease characterized by single or recurrent episodes of venous arterial or
      mixed thrombosis in a neonate whose mother does not have antiphospholipid syndrome
      manifestations. Patients present positive antiphospholipid antibodies and may
      have additional abnormalities associated (e.g. cardiac valve disease livedo
      reticularis thrombocytopenia nephropathy neurological manifestations).
