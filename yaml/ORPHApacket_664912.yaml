  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare vascular condition characterized by the formation of a thrombus
      (blood clot) in the renal vein of a newborn infant typically within the first
      28 days of life. This condition can cause renal (kidney) ischemia and may lead
      to kidney damage swelling and potential loss of kidney function. Neonatal renal
      vein thrombosis (NRVT) can affect one kidney (unilateral) or both kidneys (bilateral)
      with the severity of symptoms often depending on the extent of the clot and
      the number of affected kidneys.
