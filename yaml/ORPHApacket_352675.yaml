  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy characterized by principally
      axonal peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy with an X-linked dominant inheritance
      pattern and the childhood-adolescence-onset of slowly progressive moderate to
      severe distal muscle weakness and atrophy of the lower extremities as well as
      distal panmodal sensory abnormalities bilateral foot deformities (pes cavus
      clawed toes) absent ankle reflexes and gait abnormalities (steppage gait). Females
      are usually asymptomatic or only present mild manifestations (mild postural
      hand tremor mild wasting of hand intrinsic muscles).
