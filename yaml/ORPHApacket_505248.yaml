  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic disease characterized by early-onset respiratory difficulties
      and frequent respiratory infections congenital heart defects dysostosis multiplex
      hepatosplenomegaly renal involvement hematopoietic abnormalities facial dysmorphism
      (coarse facial features large forehead synophrys long eyelashes broad nasal
      bridge macroglossia short neck and low hairline) and global developmental delay.
      Laboratory examination shows increased urinary excretion of glycosaminoglycans
      and increased plasma heparan sulfate but no lysosomal enzyme deficiency. The
      disease is usually fatal in the first years of life.
