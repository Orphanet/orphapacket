  TextSection:
    Contents: Deafness-craniofacial syndrome is characterised by the association of
      congenital hearing loss and facial dysmorphism (facial asymmetry a broad nasal
      root and small nasal alae). It has been described in two members (father and
      daughter) of one Jewish family. Temporal alopecia was also noted. Transmission
      appeared to be autosomal dominant.
