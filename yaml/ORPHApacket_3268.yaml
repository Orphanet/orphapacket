  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare syndrome with synostosis and limb malformations characterized
      by radioulnar synostosis short stature microcephaly scoliosis and intellectual
      disability. Majority of the patients also have clinodactyly (and sometimes brachymesophalangy)
      of the fifth fingers syndactyly and brachydactyly of fingers. Joint laxity of
      the fingers and knees can also be present. Additional clinical features may
      include global developmental/psychomotor delay (notably speech delay) attention
      deficit hyperactivity and variable dysmorphic features (including hypotelorism
      prominent eyes and nose and dysmorphic ears).
