  TextSection:
    Contents: Proton-pump inhibitor-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) is
      a rare gastroenterologic disease characterized by typical clinical endoscopic
      and histological features of eosinophilic oesophagitis (i.e. symptomatic oesophageal
      dysfunction associated with eosinophil-predominant mucose infiltrate) which
      completely remits upon proton pump inhibitor therapy.
