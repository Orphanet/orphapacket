  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare primary bone dysplasia characterized by severe mesomelic shortness
      particularly of the lower limbs with distinctive triangular or rhomboid-shaped
      tibiae and fibulae accompanied by bony protuberances and skin dimples. Additional
      manifestations include radioulnar synostosis dislocation of the radial head
      abnormalities of the hands (such as oligosyndactyly or fusiform-shaped fingers)
      and feet (pes equinovarus synostoses of tarsals/metatarsals and phalanges) and
      dysmorphic facial features.
