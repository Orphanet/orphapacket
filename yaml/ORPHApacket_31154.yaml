  TextSection:
    Contents: A group of rare hypolipidemias characterized by permanently low plasma
      levels (below the 5th percentile) of total cholesterol low density lipoprotein
      cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Patients may present with malnutrition growth
      delay/failure fat malabsorption diarrhea with steatorrhea low levels/deficiency
      of liposoluble vitamins A E and K hepatic complications (typically hepatomegaly
      with steatosis sometimes cirrhosis) neurological (such as spastic ataxia) neuromuscular
      and ophthalmologic manifestations including atypical retinitis pigmentosa. Diseases
      in this group progress more severely when they manifest in early childhood.
      However benign hypobetalipoproteinemia is generally asymptomatic and occasionally
      associated with dietary intolerance to fat steatorrhea after oral intake of
      lipids moderate cytolysis cholelithiasis moderately low levels of liposoluble
      vitamins and acanthocytosis in adults. Moderate hepatic steatosis and paresthesia
      of the extremities are sometimes observed.
