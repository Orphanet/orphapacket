  TextSection:
    Contents: Spinocerebellar ataxia type 43 is a rare autosomal dominant cerebellar
      ataxia type I disorder characterized by late adult-onset of slowly progressive
      cerebellar ataxia typically presenting with balance and gait disturbances in
      association with axonal peripheral neuropathy resulting in reduced/absent deep
      tendon reflexes and sensory impairment. Lower limb pain and amyotrophy may be
      present as well as various cerebellar signs including dysarthria nystagmus hypometric
      saccades and tremor.
