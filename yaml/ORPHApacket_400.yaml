  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare parasitic disease characterized by slowly enlarging cysts of
      the liver lungs and other organs which often go unnoticed for years. They are
      caused principally by the larval form (also called metacestode) of Echinococcus
      granulosus sensu lato tapeworm. The adult form of this tapeworm parasitizes
      the intestine of dogs. Cystic echinococcosis (formerly hydatidosis) generally
      affects large domestic herbivores and humans are dead-end hosts infected through
      contact with herding dogs or through ingestion of food contaminated with canine
      excrement.
