  TextSection:
    Contents: Distal nebulin myopathy is a rare slowly progressive autosomal recessive
      distal myopathy characterized by early onset of predominantly distal muscle
      weakness and atrophy affecting lower leg extensor muscles finger extensors and
      neck flexors. Muscle histology does not always show nemaline rods.
