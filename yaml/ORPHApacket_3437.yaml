  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare bilateral granulomatous panuveitis characterized by an acute
      phase with serous retinal detachments associated with neurological (meningitis)
      and auditory alterations which in case of delayed (>3-4 weeks) or insufficient
      treatment evolves into a chronic phase with chronic anterior uveitis and retinal
      atrophic lesions (Dalen-Fuchs nodules and sunset glow fundus) associated with
      dermatological alterations. The disease is marked by increased choroidal inflammatory
      activity.
