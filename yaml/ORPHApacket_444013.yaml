  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare mitochondrial disease characterized by early onset of hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy and variable neurologic symptoms including global developmental
      delay hypotonia intellectual disability visual impairment and seizures. Lactic
      acidosis is present in all patients. Muscle biopsy usually shows decreased activity
      of mitochondrial complexes I and IV. Brain imaging may reveal variable abnormal
      signal intensities in the thalamus basal ganglia and/or brain stem.
