    Contents: A rare genetic neurometabolic disease characterized by early neonatal
      refractory seizures hypotonia and respiratory failure. Brain imaging reveals
      simplified gyral pattern of the frontal lobes white matter abnormalities gliosis
      and volume loss in various brain regions and vasogenic edema. Serum glutamine
      levels are significantly elevated. Death occurs within weeks after birth.
