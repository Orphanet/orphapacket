  TextSection:
    Contents: A form of hereditary cerebral hemorrhage with amyloidosis characterized
      by an age of onset of 50 years of age dementia and lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.
      This subtype is due to a mutation in the <i>APP</i> gene (21q21.2) encoding
      the beta-amyloid precursor protein. This mutation causes an increased accumulation
      of amyloid-beta protein in the walls of the arteries and capillaries of the
      meninges cerebellar cortex and cerebral cortex leading to the weakening and
      eventual rupture of these vessels.
