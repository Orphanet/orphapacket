    Contents: Sitosterolemia is a rare autosomal recessive sterol storage disease
      characterized by the accumulation of phytosterols in the blood and tissues.
      Clinical manifestations include xanthomas arthralgia and premature atherosclerosis.
      Hematological manifestations include hemolytic anemia with stomatocytosis and
      macrothrombocytopenia. The disease is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous
      mutations in <i>ABCG5<i> (2p21) and <i>ABCG8</i> (2p21) genes.
