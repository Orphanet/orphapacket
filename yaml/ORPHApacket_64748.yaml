    Contents: A clinical entity that represents a severe phenotype of Charcot-Marie-Tooth
      disease characterized by onset occurring in infancy severe motor weakness delayed
      motor development extremely slow nerve conduction (< 10-12 m/s) areflexia and
      foot deformity. Mutations in the genes <i>PMP22</i> (17p12) <i>MPZ</i> (1q22)
      <i>EGR2</i> (10q21.1) and <i>PRX</i> (19q13.2) have been implicated.
