    Contents: A rare nervous system tumor characterized by a benign pigmented space-occupying
      lesion derived from leptomeningeal melanocytes. Symptoms typically show insidious
      onset and are related to the mass effect on adjacent tissues. Depending on the
      location of the tumor they include focal neurological deficits increased intracranial
      pressure seizures and spinal cord compression among others. Although the tumor
      may behave aggressively prognosis is good after complete surgical resection.
