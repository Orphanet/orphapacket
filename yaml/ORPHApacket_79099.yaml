  TextSection:
    Contents: Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis with arthritis is a rare rheumatologic
      disease characterized by the occurrence of inflammatory arthritis in association
      with large erythematous symmetrical cutaneous lesions (ranging from typical
      but infrequent cord-like lesions on the flanks to more common violaceous plaques
      on the trunk and limbs) featuring a typical histologic infiltrate mainly constituted
      of histiocytes.
