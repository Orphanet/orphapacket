  TextSection:
    Contents: STT3B-CDG is a form of congenital disorders of N-linked glycosylation
      characterized by intrauterine growth retardation microcephaly failure to thrive
      developmental delay intellectual disability hypotonia seizures optic nerve atrophy
      and respiratory difficulties. Genital abnormalities (micropenis hypoplastic
      scrotum undescended testes) have also been reported. STT3B-CDG is caused by
      mutations in the gene <i>STT3B</i> (3p24.1).
