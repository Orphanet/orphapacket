  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare urinary tract tumor characterized by a malignant neoplasm arising
      from urothelial cells of the pyelocaliceal cavities and ureter. The tumor may
      be multifocal and bilateral in some cases and is more common in males than in
      females. Cigarette smoking and occupational exposure are major risk factors.
      Patients most commonly present with visible or non-visible hematuria and/or
      flank pain due to obstruction of the flow of urine by tumor tissue or (less
      often) to local tumor growth. Systemic symptoms such as anorexia weight loss
      malaise fatigue fever night sweats or cough can be associated with advanced
      stages.
