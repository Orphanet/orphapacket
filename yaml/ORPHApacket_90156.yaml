  TextSection:
    Contents: Centrifugal lipodystrophy is a rare acquired localized lipodistrophy
      characterized by single or occasionally multiple centrifugally progressive asymptomatic
      to sometimes mildly tender hypopigmented lipoatrophic skin depressions with
      weakly erymatheous inflammatory borders typically associated with regional ipsilateral
      lymph nodes swelling. Lesions typically occur on lower trunk (in particular
      groin and abdomen region) followed by upper trunk (axilla and neighboring regions)
      and rarely neck and head. It is usually not associated with systemic disease
      and is typically self-resolving.
