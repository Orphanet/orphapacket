  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare retinal vasculopathy characterized by impaired venous return
      from the retinal circulation due to an occlusion occurring within or posterior
      to the optic nerve head. The clinical presentation is variable and may range
      from asymptomatic to an abrupt and profound loss of vision. Complications causing
      visual loss include macular edema macular ischemia optic neuropathy vitreous
      hemorrhage tractional retinal detachment and in more severe cases extensive
      capillary non-perfusion with a high risk of neovascular glaucoma.
