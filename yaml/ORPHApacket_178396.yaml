    Contents: A rare genetic constitutional coagulation factor defect disorder characterized
      by a bleeding tendancy of variable severity due to methionine 358 to arginine
      replacement (Pittsburgh mutation) in the alpha-1-antitrypsin protein. Patients
      present with spontaneous hematomas hematomas following minor trauma or surgery
