  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis characterized by adulthood-onset
      (13-25 years-few exceptions of earlier onset were reported) retinal dystrophy
      (notably retinitis pigmentosa) and cerebellar ataxia with progressive cerebellar
      atrophy. Generalised tonic-clonic epilepsy myoclonus dystonia and cognitive
      decline are frequently observed whereas visual hallucinations pyramidal syndrome
      and parkinsonism may be present in some patients. Disease progression may be
      slower compared to other ceroid lipofuscinosis diseases.
