  TextSection:
    Contents: Foveal hypoplasia-presenile cataract syndrome is a rare genetic ocular
      disease characterized by congenital nystagmus (horizontal vertical and/or torsional)
      foveal hypoplasia presenile cataracts (with typical onset in the second to third
      decade of life) and normal irides. Corneal pannus and/or optic nerve hypoplasia
      may also be present.
