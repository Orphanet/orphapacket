  TextSection:
    Contents: Hirschsprung disease-deafness-polydactyly syndrome is an extremely rare
      malformative association described in only two siblings to date characterized
      by Hirschsprung disease (defined by the presence of an aganglionic segment of
      variable extent in the terminal part of the colon that leads to symptoms of
      intestinal obstruction including constipation and abdominal distension) polydactyly
      of hands and/or feet unilateral renal agenesis hypertelorism and congenital
      deafness. There have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1988.
