    Contents: A rare systemic autoimmune disease characterized by an aggressive fibroinflammatory
      process with infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the mediastinum potentially
      resulting in compression and functional impairment of vital mediastinal structures
      and associated with elevated serum IgG4. Clinical symptoms are unspecific and
      include pain or symptoms due to mass effect. The condition may occur together
      with IgG4-related disease in other parts of the body.
