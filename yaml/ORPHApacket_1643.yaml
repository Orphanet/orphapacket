  TextSection:
    Contents: Xp22.3 microdeletion syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome resulting
      from a partial deletion of the chromosome X. Phenotype is highly variable (depending
      on length of deletion) but is mainly characterized by X linked ichthyosis mild-moderate
      intellectual deficit Kallmann syndrome short stature chondrodysplasia punctata
      and ocular albinism. Epilepsy attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder autism
      and difficulties with social communication can be associated.
