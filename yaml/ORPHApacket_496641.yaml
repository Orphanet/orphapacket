    Contents: A rare genetic neurodegenerative disease characterized by early-onset
      diffuse brain atrophy growth failure with postnatal microcephaly developmental
      delay regression profound intellectual disability hypotonia muscle weakness
      and atrophy intractable seizures spasticity and optic atrophy. Patients are
      usually immobile and often require mechanical ventilation. Brain imaging shows
      cerebral and cerebellar atrophy hypomyelination and thin corpus callosum.
