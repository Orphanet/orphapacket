  TextSection:
    Contents: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare and benign but
      locally aggressive fibrovascular tumor arising from the posterolateral wall
      of the nasopharynx which affects mainly young and adolescent males (onset usually
      occurring between 7-19 years of age) and that presents as a mass in the nasopharynx
      and nasal cavity leading to manifestations such as nasal obstruction epistaxis
      profound facial swelling proptosis or diplopia. Although slowly progressive
      it has a high rate of recurrence and sometimes invades adjacent structures.
