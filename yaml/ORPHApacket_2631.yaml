  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare multiple congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized
      by mesomelic shortening and bowing of the limbs camptodactyly skin dimpling
      and cleft palate with retrognathia and mandibular hypoplasia. Fatal course due
      to cardiorespiratory arrest has also been reported. There have been no further
      descriptions in the literature since 1993.
