  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by severe headaches with
      or without focal neurological deficits or seizures and a reversible segmental
      and multifocal vasoconstriction of cerebral arteries. It may occur spontaneously
      or be provoked by various precipitating factors the most common being postpartum
      and exposure to various vasoactive substances such as illicit drugs and selective
      serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. The major complication is ischemic or hemorrhagic
      stroke.
