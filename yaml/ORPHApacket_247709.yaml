    Contents: A rare form of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome characterized
      by aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma in association with other endocrine
      tumors notably pheochromocytoma (one or both adrenal glands can be affected).
      Onset is typically in infancy or childhood and patients often have a typical
      facies (mucosal neuromas of the lips and tongue and bumpy lips) ophthalmologic
      abnormalities (alacrima in infancy thickened and everted eyelids mild ptosis
      and prominent corneal nerves) skeletal anomalies (marfanoid body habitus narrow
      long facies pes cavus pectus excavatum high-arched palate scoliosis hyperextensible
      joints and slipped capital femoral epiphyses) and a generalized ganglioneuromatosis
      throughout the aerodigestive tract. Chronic constipation abdominal distension
      diarrhea or megacolon at birth are often the initial manifestations.
