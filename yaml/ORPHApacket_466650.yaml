    Contents: "A rare disease with malignant hyperthermia characterized by exercise-induced\
      \ life-threatening hyperthermia with a body temperature over 40\xB0C and signs\
      \ of encephalopathy ranging from confusion to convulsions or coma. Incidence\
      \ increases with rising ambient temperature and relative humidity. Manifestations\
