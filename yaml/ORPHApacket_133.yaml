    Contents: A pneumoconiosis characterized by granulomatous inflammation that occurs
      in individuals who develop beryllium sensitization (BeS) a cell-mediated immune
      response to environmental and occupational beryllium exposure. BeS precedes
      the lung disease that may present with chronic dry cough fatigue weight loss
