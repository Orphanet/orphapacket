  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17-alpha-hydroxylase
      (CYP17A1) deficiency and characterized by glucocorticoid deficiency mineralocorticoid
      excess leading to hypokalemic hypertension and sex steroid deficiency (hypergonadotrophic
      hypogonadism). Undervirilization and even female phenotype in 46,XY males primary
      amenorrhea in females and lack of pubertal development in both sexes is common.
      Residual CYP17A1 activity is associated with the severity of this condition
      with a large spectrum of variability from presenting in early infancy to unusually
      mild courses with isolated sex steroid deficiency but normal ACTH-stimulated
      cortisol in adult patients.
