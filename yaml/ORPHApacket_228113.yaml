  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare intestinal condition characterized by an abnormal communication
      between the lower rectum and the perianal skin which usually develops after
      an acute perianal abscess. A fistulous traject may be established on either
      side of the anus (never in the midline) and mucous or fecal discharge can appear.
      The skin around the external orifice can be irritated. Males are more often
      affected than females.
