  TextSection:
    Contents: Tricho-retino-dento-digital syndrome is an autosomal dominant ectodermal
      dysplasia syndrome characterized by uncombable hair syndrome congenital hypotrichosis
      and dental abnormalities such as oligodontia or hyperdontia and associated with
      early-onset cataract retinal pigmentary dystrophy and brachydactyly with brachymetacarpia.
      Furthermore hyperactivity and a mild intellectual deficit have been reported
      in affected patients.
