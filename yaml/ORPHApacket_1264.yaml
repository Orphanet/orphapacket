  TextSection:
    Contents: Tricho-retino-dento-digital syndrome is an autosomal dominant ectodermal
      dysplasia syndrome characterized by uncombable hair syndrome (see this term)
      congenital hypotrichosis and dental abnormalities such as oligodontia (see this
      term) or hyperdontia and associated with early-onset cataract retinal pigmentary
      dystrophy and brachydactyly with brachymetacarpia. Furthermore hyperactivity
      and a mild intellectual deficit have been reported in affected patients.
