  TextSection:
    Contents: Camptobrachydactyly is an extremely rare brachydactyly syndrome characterized
      by short broad hands and feet with brachydactyly associated with congenital
      flexion contractures of the proximal and/or distal interphalangeal joints of
      the fingers as well as syndactyly of feet. Polydactyly septate vagina and urinary
      incontinence were also occasionally reported. Camptobrachydactyly has been described
      in 18 members of 1 family suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance. There
      have been no further descriptions in the literature since 1972.
