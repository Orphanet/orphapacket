  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare predominantly axonal hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy
      characterized by a broad phenotypic spectrum of slowly progressive signs and
      symptoms mainly affecting the lower limbs. Most patients present with gait difficulties
      and distal sensory impairment while some may lack sensory symptoms altogether.
      Pes cavus is frequently reported. Age of onset is also highly variable ranging
      from childhood to late adulthood.
