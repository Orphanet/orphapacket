  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare severe multiple congenital anomalies syndrome characterized by
      severe mandibular hypoplasia upper limb phocomelia with oligodactyly absent
      fibula and a number of additional skeletal (hypoplastic scapula and ischii 11
      ribs clubfeet) facial (hypertelorism hypoplastic supraorbital ridges wide nasal
      bridge microtia with low-set ears) and variable internal organ abnormalities
      (including arhinencephaly hypolobulated lungs and congenital cardiac defects)
      which usually lead to perinatal death. Surviving patients show features similar
      to Nagel syndrome.
