  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy disorder characterized
      by the typical CMT phenotype (slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and
      atrophy in upper and lower limbs distal sensory loss in extremities reduced
      or absent deep tendon reflexes and foot deformities) associated with focal segmental
      glomerulosclerosis (manifesting with proteinuria and progression to end-stage
      renal disease). Mild or moderate sensorineural hearing loss may also be associated.
      Nerve biopsy reveals both axonal and demyelinating changes and nerve conduction
      velocities vary from the demyelinating to axonal range (typically between 25-50m/sec).
