  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic brachydactyly syndrome characterized by the association
      of brachydactyly type E with hypertension (due to vascular or neurovascular
      anomalies) as well as the additional features of short stature and low birth
      weight (compared to non-affected family members) stocky build and a round face.
      The onset of hypertension is often in childhood.
