  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare subtype of autosomal dominant limb girdle muscular dystrophy
      characterized by an adult onset of proximal shoulder and hip girdle weakness
      (that later progresses to include distal weakness) nasal speech and dysarthria.
      Other frequent findings include tightened heel cords reduced deep-tendon reflexes
      and elevated creatine kinase serum levels. Respiratory failure as well as mild
      facial weakness and dysphagia may also be observed.
