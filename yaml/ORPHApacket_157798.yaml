  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare genetic intestinal disease characterized by the presence of multiple
      (usually large) hyperplastic/serrated colorectal polyps usually with a pancolonic
      distribution. Histology reveals hyperplastic polyps sessile serrated adenomas
      (most common) traditional serrated adenomas or mixed polyps. It is associated
      with an increased personal and familial (first-degree relatives) risk of colorectal
      cancer.
