  TextSection:
    Contents: Macrosomia-microphthalmia-cleft palate syndrome is a rare genetic multiple
      congenital anomalies/dysmorphic syndrome characterized by early macrosomia bilateral
      severe microphthalmia and a protuberant abdomen with hepatomegaly. Additional
      reported features include brachycephaly large fontanelles prominent forehead
      upturned nose and median cleft palate. Cyanotic apneic spells and overwhelming
      infection lead to death within the first 6 months of life. There have been no
      further descriptions in the literature since 1989.
