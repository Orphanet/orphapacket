  TextSection:
    Contents: A rare soft tissue tumor characterized by a well-circumscribed mass
      potentially occurring at any anatomical site histopathologically showing spindled
      to ovoid cells arranged around a branching and hyalinized vasculature and variable
      stromal collagen deposition. Immunohistochemistry reveals CD34 and/or STAT6
      expression. <i>NAB2-STAT6</i> gene fusions are pathognomonic for this tumor
      which may be malignant or benign. Clinically most patients present with a slow-growing
      painless mass. Large tumors may cause paraneoplastic syndromes such as Doege-Potter
      syndrome with the induction of severe hypoglycemia or acromegaloid features.
