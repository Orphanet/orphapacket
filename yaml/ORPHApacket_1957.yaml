  TextSection:
    Contents: Esthesioneuroblastoma (ENB) is a rare malignant neoplasm of the sinonasal
      cavity arising from the basal layers of olfactory neuroepithelial cells in the
      superior nasal vault which usually occurs in the 5th to 6th decades of life
      and is characterized clinically by non-specific symptoms such as progressive
      ipsilateral nasal block sinusitis facial pain intermittent headaches hyposmia/dysosmia
      rhinorrhea and epistaxis as well as proptosis diplopia and excessive lacrimation
      due to orbital extension. With early treatment and in the absence of distant
      metastases ENB appears to have a good prognosis (compared to other superior
      nasal malignancies) despite a high rate of cervical metastases.
